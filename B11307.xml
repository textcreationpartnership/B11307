            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And though the Sects of Philoſophers of that Kinde be gone, yet there remaine certaine diſcourſing Wits, which are of the ſame veines, though there be not ſo much Bloud in them, as was in thoſe of the Ancients. But it is not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:176830:7"/>onely the Difficultie, and Labour, which Men take in finding out of <hi>Truth;</hi> Nor againe, that when it is found, it impoſeth vpon mens Thoughts; that doth bring <hi>Lies</hi> in fauour: But a naturall, though cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Loue, of the <hi>Lie</hi> it ſelfe. One of the later Schoole of the Grecians, examineth the matter, and is at a ſtand, to thinke what ſhould be in it, that men ſhould loue <hi>Lies;</hi> Where neither they make for Pleaſure, as with Poets; Nor for Aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as with the Merchant; but for the <hi>Lies</hi> ſake. But I cannot tell: This ſame <hi>Truth,</hi> is a Naked, and Open day light, that doth not ſhew, the Maſques, and Mummeries, and Triumphs of the world, halfe ſo Stately, and daintily, as Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. <hi>Truth</hi> may perhaps come to the price of a Pearle, that ſheweth beſt by day: But it will not riſe, to the price of a Diamond, or Carbuncle, that ſheweth beſt in varied lights. A mixture of a <hi>Lie</hi> doth euer adde Pleaſure. Doth any man doubt, that if there were taken out of Mens Mindes, Vaine Opinions, Flattering
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:176830:7"/>Hopes, Falſe valuations, Imaginations as one would, and the like; but it would leaue the Mindes, of a Number of Men, poore ſhrunken Things; full of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and Indiſpoſition, and vnpleaſing to themſelues? One of the Fathers, in great Seuerity, called Poeſie, <hi>Vinum Daemonum;</hi> becauſe it filleth the Imagination, and yet it is, but with the ſhadow of a <hi>Lie.</hi> But it is not the <hi>Lie,</hi> that paſſeth through the Minde, but the <hi>Lie</hi> that ſinketh in, and ſetleth in it, that doth the hurt, ſuch as we ſpake of before. But howſoeuer theſe things are thus, in mens depraued Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Affections, yet <hi>Truth,</hi> which onely doth iudge it ſelfe, teacheth, that the Inquirie of <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the Loue-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or Wooing of it; The knowledge of <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the Preſence of it; and the Beleefe of <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the Enioying of it; is the Soueraigne Good of humane Nature. The firſt Creature of God, in the workes of the Dayes, was the Light of the Senſe; The laſt, was the Light of Reaſon; And his Sabbath Worke, euer ſince, is the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176830:8"/>Illumination of his Spirit. Firſt he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed Light, vpon the Face, of the Matter or Chaos; Then he breathed Light, into the Face of Man; and ſtill he breatheth and inſpireth Light, into the Face of his Choſen. The Poet, that beautified the Sect, that was otherwiſe inferiour to the reſt, ſaith yet excellently well: <hi>It is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſtand vpon the ſhore, and to ſee ſhips toſt vpon the Sea: A pleaſure to ſtand in the window of a Caſtle, and to ſee a Battaile, and the Aduentures thereof, below: But no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is comparable, to the ſtanding, vpon the vantage ground of Truth:</hi> (A hill not to be commanded, and where the Ayre is alwaies cleare and ſerene;) <hi>And to ſee the Errours, and Wandrings, and Miſts, and Tempeſts, in the vale below:</hi> So alwaies, that this proſpect, be with Pitty, and not with Swelling, or Pride. Certainly, it is Heauen vpon Earth, to haue a Mans Minde Moue in Charitie, Reſt in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and Turne vpon the Poles of <hi>Truth.</hi>

For theſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and crooked courſes, are the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Serpent; which goeth baſely vpon the belly, and not vpon the Feet. There is no Vice, that doth ſo couer a Man with Shame, as to be found falſe, and perfidious. And therefore <hi>Mountaigny</hi> ſaith prettily, when he enquired the reaſon, why the word of the <hi>Lie,</hi> ſhould be ſuch a Diſgrace, and ſuch an Odious Charge? Saith he, <hi>If it be well weighed, To ſay that a man lieth, is as much to ſay, as that he is braue towards God, and a Coward towards men.</hi> For a <hi>Lie</hi> faces God, and ſhrinkes from Man.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eligion</hi> being the chiefe Band of humane Society, it is a happy thing, when it ſelfe, is well contained, within the true Band of <hi>Vnity.</hi> The Quarrels, and Diuiſions about <hi>Religion,</hi> were Euils vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the Heathen. The Reaſon was, becauſe the <hi>Religion</hi> of the Heathen, conſiſted rather in Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; then in any conſtant Beleefe.

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:176830:11"/>of the <hi>Church; What are the Fruits thereof; what the Bounds; And what the Meanes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Fruits of Vnity</hi> (next vnto the well Pleaſing of God, which is All in All) are two; The One, towards thoſe, that are <hi>without the Church;</hi> The Other, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe, <hi>that are within.</hi> For the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; It is certaine, that Hereſies, and Schiſmes, are of all others, the greateſt Scandals; yea more then Corruption of Manners. For as in the Naturall Body, a Wound or Solution of Continuity, is worſe then a Corrupt Humor; So in the Spirituall. So that nothing, doth ſo much keepe Men out of the Church, and driue Men out of the Church, as Breach of <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> And therefore, whenſoeuer it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to that paſſe, that one ſaith, <hi>Ecce in Deſerto;</hi> Another ſaith, <hi>Ecce in penetrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus;</hi> That is, when ſome Men ſeeke Chriſt, in the Conuenticles of Heretikes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in an Outward Face of a Church, that voice had need continually to ſound in Mens Eares, <hi>Nolite exire, Goe not out.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:176830:12"/>The Doctor of the Gentiles (the Propriety of whoſe Vocation, drew him to haue a ſpeciall care of thoſe <hi>without</hi>) ſaith; <hi>If an Heathen come in, and heare you ſpeake with ſeuerall Tongues, Will he not ſay that you are mad?</hi> And certainly, it is little better, when Atheiſts, and prophane Perſons, do heare of ſo many Diſcordant, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinions in <hi>Religion;</hi> It doth auert them from the Church, and maketh them, <hi>To ſit downe in the chaire of the Scorners.</hi> It is but a light Thing, to be Vouched in ſo Serious a Matter, but yet it expreſſeth well the Deformity. There is a Maſter of Scoffing; that in his Catalogue of Books, of a faigned Library, ſets Downe this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a Booke; <hi>The morris daunce of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</hi> For indeed, euery Sect of them, hath a Diuers Poſture, or Cringe by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which cannot but Moue Deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Worldlings, and Depraued Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, who are apt to contemne Holy Things.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Fruit towards thoſe that are within;</hi> It is <hi>Peace;</hi> which containeth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:176830:12"/>infinite Bleſſings: It eſtabliſheth Faith; It kindleth Charity; The outward Peace of the Church, Diſtilleth into Peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; And it turneth the Labours, of Writing, and Reading of Controuerſies, into Treaties of Mortification, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Bounds of Vnity;</hi> The true Placing of them, importeth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. There appeare to be two extremes. For to certaine <hi>Zelants</hi> all Speech of Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is odious. <hi>Is it peace Iehu? What haſt thou to doe with peace? turne thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde me. Peace</hi> is not the Matter, but <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi> and <hi>Party.</hi> Contrariwiſe, certaine <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> and Luke-warme Perſons, thinke they may accommodate Points of <hi>Religion,</hi> by Middle Waies, and taking part of both; And witty Reconcilements; As if they would make an Arbitrement, betweene God and Man. Both theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes are to be auoyded; which will be done, if the League of Chriſtians, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Sauiour himſelfe, were in the two croſſe Clauſes thereof, ſoundly and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:176830:13"/>plainly expounded; <hi>He that is not with vs, is againſt vs:</hi> And againe; <hi>He that is not againſt vs, is with vs:</hi> That is, if the Points Fundamentall and of Subſtance in <hi>Religion,</hi> were truly diſcerned and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, from Points not meerely of Faith, but of Opinion, Order, or good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. This is a Thing, may ſeeme to many, a Matter triuiall, and done already: But if it were done leſſe partially, it would be embraced more generally.</p>
            <p>Of this I may giue onely this Aduice, according to my ſmall Modell. Men ought to take heede, of rending Gods Church, by two kinds of Controuerſies. The one is, when the Matter of the Point controuerted, is too ſmall and light, not worth the Heat, and Strife about it, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led onely by Contradiction. For, as it is noted by one of the Fathers; <hi>Chriſts Coat, indeed, had no ſeame: But the Churches Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture was of diuers colours;</hi> whereupon he ſaith, <hi>In veſte varietas ſit, Sciſſura non ſit;</hi> They be two Things, <hi>Vnity,</hi> and <hi>Vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</hi> The other is, when the Matter of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176830:13"/>the Point Controuerted is great; but it is driuen to an ouer-great Subtilty, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity; So that it becommeth a Thing, rather Ingenious, then Subſtantiall. A man that is of Iudgement and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſhall ſometimes heare Ignorant Men differ, and know well within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that thoſe which ſo differ, meane one thing, and yet they themſelues would neuer agree. And if it come ſo to paſſe, in that diſtance of Iudgement, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Man and Man; Shall wee not thinke, that God aboue, that knowes the Heart, doth not diſcerne, that fraile Men, in ſome of their Contradictions, intend the ſame thing; and accepteth of both? The Nature of ſuch Controuerſies, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently expreſſed, by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Warning and Precept, that he giueth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame, <hi>Deuita profanas vocum Nouitates, &amp; Oppoſitiones falſi Nominis Scientiae.</hi> Men create Oppoſitions, which are not; And put them into new termes, ſo fixed, as whereas the Meaning ought to gouerne the Terme, the Terme in effect
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:176830:14"/>gouerneth the Meaning. There be alſo two falſe <hi>Peaces,</hi> or <hi>Vnities;</hi> The one, when the <hi>Peace</hi> is grounded, but vpon an implicite ignorance; For all Colours will agree in the Darke: The other, when it is peeced vp, vpon a direct Admiſſion of Contraries, in Fundamentall Points. For Truth and Falſhood, in ſuch things, are like the <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay, in the toes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucadnezars Image;</hi> They may Cleaue, but they will not Incorporate.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Meanes of procuring V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> Men muſt beware, that in the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or Muniting, of <hi>Religious Vnity,</hi> they doe not Diſſolue and Deface the Lawes of Charity, and of humane Society. There be two Swords amongſt Chriſtians; the Spirituall, and Temporall; And both haue their due Office, and place, in the maintenance of <hi>Religion.</hi> But we may not take vp the Third ſword, which is Mahomets Sword, or like vnto it; That is, to propagate <hi>Religion,</hi> by Warrs, or by San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary Perſecutions, to force Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; except it be in caſes of Ouert Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:176830:14"/>Blaſphemy, or Intermixture of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize, againſt the State; Much leſſe to Nouriſh Seditions; To Authorize Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies and Rebellions; To put the Sword into the Peoples Hands; And the like; Tending to the Subuerſion of all Gouernment, which is the Ordinance of God. For this is, but to daſh the firſt Table, againſt the Second; And ſo to conſider Men as Chriſtians, as we forget that they are Men. <hi>Lucretius</hi> the Poet, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Act of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> that could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Sacrificing of his owne Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, exclaimed;
<q>Tantum Relligio potuit ſuadere malorum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What would he haue ſaid, if he had knowne of the Maſſacre in France, or the Powder Treaſon of England? He would haue beene, Seuen times more Epicure and Atheiſt, then he was. For as the temporall Sword, is to bee drawne, with great circumſpection, in Caſes of <hi>Religion;</hi> So it is a thing monſtrous, to put it into the hands of the Common People. Let that bee left vnto the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:176830:15"/>and other Furies. It was great Blaſphemy, when the Deuill ſaid; <hi>I will aſcend, and be like the Higheſt;</hi> But it is greater Blaſphemy, to perſonate God, and bring him in ſaying; <hi>I will deſcend, and be like the Prince of Darkneſſe;</hi> And what is it better, to make the cauſe of <hi>Religion,</hi> to deſcend, to the cruell and execrable Actions, of Murthering Princes, Butchery of People, and Subuerſion of States, and Gouernments? Surely, this is to bring Downe the Holy Ghoſt, in ſtead of the Likneſſe of a Doue, in the Shape of a Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Rauen: And to ſet, out of the Barke of a Chriſtian Church, a Flagge of a Barque of Pirats, and <hi>Aſſaſsins.</hi> Therfore it is moſt neceſſary, that the Church by Doctrine and Decree; Princes by their Sword; And all Learnings, both Chriſtian and Morall, as by their Mercury Rod; Doe Damne and ſend to Hell, for euer, thoſe Facts and Opinions, tending to the Support of the ſame; As hath beene already in good part done. Surely in Counſels, Concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:176830:15"/>Counſel of the Apoſtle would be prefixed; <hi>Ira hominis non implet Iuſticiam Dei.</hi> And it was a notable Obſeruation, of a wiſe Father, And no leſſe ingenuouſly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; <hi>That thoſe, which held and perſwaded, preſſure of Conſciences, were commonly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed therin, themſelues, for their owne ends.</hi>

            <p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:176830:19"/>of <hi>Arts</hi> or <hi>Policy,</hi> and <hi>Diſsimulation</hi> or <hi>Cloſeneſſe,</hi> are indeed Habits and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſeuerall, and to be diſtinguiſhed. For if a Man, haue that Penetration of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he can diſcerne, what Things are to be laid open, and what to be ſecretted, and what to be ſhewed at Halfe lights, and to whom, and when, (which indeed are Arts of State, and Arts of Life, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> well calleth them) to him, A Habit of <hi>Diſsimulation,</hi> is a Hinderance, and a Pooreneſſe. But if a Man cannot obtaine to that Iudgment, then it is left to him, generally, to be Cloſe, and a <hi>Diſſembler.</hi> For where a Man cannot chooſe, or vary in Particulars, there it is good to take the ſafeſt and warieſt Way in generall; Like the Going ſoftly by one that cannot well ſee. Certainly the ableſt Men, that euer were, haue had all an Openneſſe, and Franckneſſe of dealing; And a name of Certainty, and Veracity; But then they were like Horſes, well mannaged; For they could tell paſſing well, when to ſtop, or turne: And at ſuch times, when they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:176830:19"/>thought the Caſe indeed, required <hi>Diſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,</hi> if then they vſed it, it came to paſſe, that the former Opinion, ſpred abroad of their good Faith, and Clearneſſe of dealing, made them almoſt Inuiſible.</p>
            <p>There be three degrees, of this Hiding, and Vailing of a Mans Selfe. The firſt <hi>Cloſeneſſe, Reſeruation,</hi> and <hi>Secrecy;</hi> when a Man leaueth himſelfe without Obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or without Hold to be taken, what he is. The ſecond <hi>Diſsimulation,</hi> in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue;</hi> when a man lets fall Signes, and Arguments, that he is not, that he is. And the third <hi>Simulation,</hi> in the Affirmatiue; when a Man induſtriouſly, and expreſſely, faigns, and pretends to be, that he is not.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, <hi>Secrecy:</hi> It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Vertue of a Confeſſour; And aſſuredly, the <hi>Secret</hi> Man, heareth many Confeſſions; For who will open him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to a Blab or a Babler? But if a man be thought <hi>Secret,</hi> it inuiteth Diſcouerie; As the more Cloſe Aire, ſucketh in the more Open: And as in Confeſſion, the Reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is not for worldly vſe, but for the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:176830:20"/>Eaſe of a Mans Heart, ſo <hi>Secret</hi> Men come to Knowledge of Many Things, in that kinde; while Men rather diſcharge their Mindes, then impart their Mindes. In few words, Myſteries are due to <hi>Secrecy.</hi> Beſides (to ſay Truth) <hi>Nakedneſſe</hi> is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely, as well in Minde, as Body; and it addeth no ſmall Reuerence, to Mens Manners, and Actions, if they be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Open. As for Talkers and Futile Perſons, they are commonly Vaine, and Credulous withall. For He that talketh, what he knoweth, will alſo talke, what he knoweth not. Therfore ſet it downe; <hi>That an Habit of Secrecy, is both Politick, and Morall.</hi> And in this Part, it is good, that a Mans Face, giue his Tongue, leaue to Speake. For the Diſcouery, of a Mans Selfe, by the Tracts of his Countenance, is a great Weakneſſe, and Betraying; By how much, it is many times, more marked and beleeued, then a Mans words.</p>
            <p>For the Second, which is <hi>Diſsimulation.</hi> It followeth many times vpon <hi>Secrecy,</hi> by a neceſſity: So that, he that will be <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:176830:20"/>muſt be a <hi>Diſſembler,</hi> in ſome degree. For Men are too cunning, to ſuffer a Man, to keepe an indifferent carriage, betweene both; and to be <hi>Secret,</hi> without Swaying the Ballance, on either ſide. They will ſo beſet a man with Queſtions, and draw him on, and picke it out of him, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an abſurd Silence, he muſt ſhew an Inclination, one way; Or if he doe not, they will gather as much by his Silence; as by his Speech. As for Equiuocations, or Oraculous Speeches, they cannot hold out long. So that no man can be ſecret, except he giue himſelfe a little Scope of <hi>Diſsimulation;</hi> which is, as it were, but the Skirts or Traine of <hi>Secrecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the third Degree, which is <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,</hi> and falſe Profeſſion; That I hold more culpable, and leſſe politicke; except it be in great and rare Matters. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a generall Cuſtome of <hi>Simulation</hi> (which is this laſt Degree) is a Vice, riſing, either of a naturall Falſeneſſe, or Feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Or of a Minde, that hath ſome maine Faults; which becauſe a man muſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:176830:21"/>needs diſguiſe, it maketh him practiſe <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,</hi> in other things, leſt his Hand ſhould be out of vre.</p>
            <p>The great <hi>Aduantages</hi> of <hi>Simulation</hi> and <hi>Diſsimulation</hi> are three. Firſt to lay aſleepe Oppoſition, and to Surprize. For where a Mans Intentions, are publiſhed, it is an Alarum, to call vp, all that are againſt them. The ſecond is, to reſerue to a Mans Selfe, a faire Retreat: For if a man engage himſelfe, by a manifeſt Declaration, he muſt goe through, or take a Fall. The third is, the better to diſcouer the Minde of another. For to him that opens him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Men will hardly ſhew themſelues aduerſe; but will (faire) let him goe on, and turne their Freedome of Speech, to Freedome of thought. And therefore, it is a good ſhrewd Prouerbe of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; <hi>Tell a lye, and finde a Troth.</hi> As if there were no way of Diſcouery, but by <hi>Simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> There be alſo three <hi>Diſaduantages,</hi> to ſet it euen. The firſt, That <hi>Simulation</hi> and <hi>Diſsimulation,</hi> commonly carry with them, a Shew of Fearfulneſſe, which in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:176830:21"/>Buſineſſe, doth ſpoile the Feathers, of round flying vp to the Mark. The ſecond, that it puſſeth &amp; perplexeth the Conceits of many; that perhaps would otherwiſe co-operate with him; and makes a Man walke, almoſt alone, to his owne Ends. The third, and greateſt is, that it depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a Man, of one, of the moſt principall Inſtruments for Action; which is <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Beleefe.</hi> The beſt Compoſition, and Temperature is, to haue <hi>Openneſſe</hi> in Fame and Opinion; <hi>Secrecy</hi> in Habit; <hi>Diſsimulation</hi> in ſeaſonable vſe; And a Power to faigne, if there be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>

            <p>Concerning <hi>thoſe that are more or leſſe ſubiect to Enuy:</hi> Firſt, Perſons of eminent Vertue, when they are aduanced, are leſſe <hi>enuied.</hi> For their Fortune ſeemeth but due vnto them; and no man <hi>Enuieth</hi> the Payment of a Debt, but Rewards, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality rather. Againe, <hi>Enuy</hi> is euer ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with the Comparing of a Mans Selfe; And where there is no Compariſon, no <hi>Enuy;</hi> And therfore Kings, are not <hi>enuied,</hi> but by Kings. Neuertheleſſe, it is to be noted, that vnworthy Perſons, are moſt <hi>enuied,</hi> at their firſt comming in, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ouercome it better; wheras con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, Perſons of Worth, and Merit, are moſt <hi>enuied,</hi> when their Fortune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:176830:28"/>long. For by that time, though their Vertue be the ſame, yet it hath not the ſame <hi>Luſtre;</hi> For freſh Men grow vp, that darken it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perſons</hi> of Noble Bloud, are leſſe <hi>enuied,</hi> in their Riſing: For it ſeemeth, but Right, done to their Birth. Beſides, there ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not much added to their Fortune; And <hi>Enuy</hi> is as the Sunne Beames, that beat hotter, vpon a Bank or ſteepe riſing Ground; then vpon a Flat. And for the ſame reaſon, thoſe that are aduanced by degrees, are leſſe <hi>enuied,</hi> then thoſe that are aduanced ſuddainly, and <hi>per ſaltum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe that haue ioyned with their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, great Trauels, Cares, or Perills, are leſſe ſubiect to <hi>Enuy.</hi> For Men thinke, that they earne their Honours hardly, and pitty them ſometimes; And <hi>Pitty,</hi> euer healeth <hi>Enuy:</hi> Wherefore, you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that the more deepe, and ſober ſort of Politique perſons, in their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are euer bemoaning themſelues, what a Life they lead; Chanting a <hi>Quanta patimur.</hi> Not that they feele it ſo, but onely
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:176830:29"/>to abate the Edge of <hi>Enuy.</hi> But this is to be vnderſtood, of Buſineſſe, that is laid vpon Men, and not ſuch as they call vnto themſelues. For Nothing increaſeth <hi>Enuy</hi> more, then an vnneceſſary, and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Ingroſſing of Buſineſſe. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth extinguiſh <hi>Enuy</hi> more, then for a great Perſon, to preſerue all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Officers, in their full Rights, and Preheminences, of their Places. For by that meanes, there be ſo many Skreenes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him, and <hi>Enuy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Aboue all, thoſe are moſt ſubiect to <hi>Enuy,</hi> which carry the Greatneſſe of their Fortunes, in an inſolent and proud Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Being neuer well, but while they are ſhewing, how great they are, Either by outward Pompe, or by Triumphing ouer all Oppoſition, or Competition; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Wiſe men will rather doe ſacrifice to <hi>Enuy;</hi> in ſuffering themſelues, ſometimes of purpoſe to be croſt, and ouerborne in things, that doe not much concerne them. Notwithſtanding, ſo much is true; That the Carriage of Greatneſſe, in a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:176830:29"/>plaine and open manner (ſo it be without Arrogancy, and Vaine glory) doth draw leſſe <hi>Enuy,</hi> then if it be in a more crafty, and cunning faſhion. For in that courſe, a Man doth but diſauow Fortune; And ſeemeth to be conſcious, of his owne want in worth; And doth but teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to <hi>Enuy</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to conclude this Part; As we faid in the beginning, that the Act of <hi>Enuy,</hi> had ſomewhat in it, of <hi>Witchcraft;</hi> ſo there is no other Cure of <hi>Enuy,</hi> but the cure of <hi>Witchcraft:</hi> And that is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the <hi>Lot</hi> (as they call it) &amp; to lay it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another. For which purpoſe, the wiſer Sort of great Perſons, bring in euer vpon the Stage, ſome Body, vpon whom to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue the <hi>Enuie,</hi> that would come vpon themſelues; Sometimes vpon Miniſters, and Seruants; Sometimes vpon Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues and Aſſociates; and the like; And for that turne, there are neuer wanting, ſome Perſons of violent and vndertaking Natures, who ſo they may haue Power, and Buſineſſe, will take it at any Coſt.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:176830:30"/>
            <p> Now to ſpeake of Publique <hi>Enuy.</hi> There is yet ſome good in <hi>Publique Enuy;</hi> whereas in <hi>Priuate,</hi> there is none. For <hi>Publique Enuy</hi> is as an <hi>Ostraciſme,</hi> that eclipſeth Men, when they grow too great. And therefore it is a Bridle alſo to Great Ones, to keepe them within Bounds.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Enuy,</hi> being in the Latine word <hi>Inuidia,</hi> goeth in the Moderne languages, by the name of <hi>Diſcontentment.</hi> Of which we ſhall ſpeake in handling <hi>Sedition.</hi> It is a diſeaſe, in a State, like to Infection. For as Infection, ſpreadeth vpon that, which is ſound, and tainteth it; So when <hi>Enuy,</hi> is gotten once into a State, it traduceth euen the beſt Actions thereof, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them into an ill Odour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is little won by intermingling of plauſible Actions. For that doth argue, but a Weakneſſe, and Feare of <hi>Enuy,</hi> which hurteth ſo much the more, as it is likewiſe vſuall in <hi>Infections;</hi> which if you feare them, you call them vpon you.</p>
            <p>This publique <hi>Enuy,</hi> ſeemeth to beat chiefly, vpon principall Officers, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:176830:30"/>rather then vpon Kings, &amp; Eſtates themſelues. But this is a ſure Rule, that if the <hi>Enuy</hi> vpon the Miniſter, be great, when the cauſe of it, in him, is ſmal; or if the <hi>Enuy</hi> be generall, in a manner, vpon all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of an Eſtate, then the <hi>Enuy</hi> (though hidden) is truly vpon the State it ſelfe. And ſo much of <hi>publike enuy</hi> or <hi>diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp; the difference therof from <hi>Priuate Enuy,</hi> which was handled in the firſt place.</p>
            <p>We will adde this, in generall, touching the Affection of <hi>Enuy;</hi> that of all other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, it is the moſt importune, and continuall. For of other <hi>Affections,</hi> there is occaſion giuen, but now and then: And therefore, it was well ſaid, <hi>Inuidia festos dies non agit.</hi> For it is euer working vpon ſome, or other. And it is alſo noted, that <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Enuy,</hi> doe make a man pine, which other Affections doe not; becauſe they are not ſo continuall. It is alſo the vileſt Affection, and the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued; For which cauſe, it is the proper Attribute, of the Deuill, who is called; <hi>The Enuious Man, that ſoweth tares amongst the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:176830:31"/>wheat by night.</hi> As it alwayes commeth to paſſe, that <hi>Enny</hi> worketh ſubtilly, and in the darke; And to the preiudice of good things, ſuch as is the <hi>Wheat.</hi>

It is a ſtrange deſire, to ſeeke Power, and to loſe Libertie; Or to ſeeke Power ouer others, and to looſe Power ouer a Mans Selfe. The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto <hi>Place</hi> is Laborious; And by Paines Men come to greater Paines; And it is ſometimes baſe; And by Indignities,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:176830:34"/>Men come to Dignities. The ſtanding is ſlippery, and the Regreſſe, is either a downefall, or at leaſt an Eclipſe, which is a Melancholy Thing. <hi>Cùm non ſis, qui fueris, non eſſe, cur velis viuere.</hi> Nay, retire Men cannot, when they would; neither will they, when it were Reaſon: But are impatient of priuateneſſe, euen in Age, and Sickneſſe, which require the Shadow: Like old Towneſmen, that will be ſtill ſitting at their Street doore; though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they offer Age to Scorne. Certainly Great Perſons, had need to borrow other Mens Opinions; to thinke themſelues happy; For if they iudge by their owne Feeling; they cannot finde it: But if they thinke with themſelues, what other men thinke of them, and that other men would faine be as they are, then they are happy, as it were by report; When per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they finde the Contrary within. For they are the firſt, that finde their owne Griefs; though they be the laſt, that finde their owne Faults. Certainly, Men in Great Fortunes, are ſtrangers to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:176830:35"/>and while they are in the puſle of buſineſſe, they haue no time to tend their Health, either of Body, or Minde. <hi>Illi Mors grauis incubat, qui notus nimis om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, ignotus moritur ſibi.</hi> In <hi>Place,</hi> There is Licenſe to doe Good, and Euill; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the latter is a Curſe; For in Euill, the beſt condition is, not to will; The Second, not to Can.

For good Thoughts (though God accept them,) yet towards men, are little better then good Dreames; Except they be put in Act; And that cannot be without Power, and Place; As the Vantage, and Commanding Ground. Merit, and good Works, is the End of Mans Motion; And Conſcience of the ſame, is the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of Mans Reſt.

Reduce things, to the firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obſerue, wherin, and how, they haue degenerate; but yet aske Counſell of both Times; Of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Time, what is beſt; and of the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Time, what is fitteſt.

But this laſt, were fitter for a Satyre, then for a ſerious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation. This is well to be weighed; That <hi>Boldneſſe</hi> is euer blinde: For it ſeeth not dangers, and Inconueniences. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is ill in Counſell, good in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So that the right Vſe of <hi>Bold</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is, that they neuer Command in Chiefe, but be Seconds, and vnder the Direction of others.

This of all Vertues, and Dignities of the Minde, is the greateſt; being the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Deitie: And without it, Man is a Buſie, Miſchieuous, Wretched Thing; No better then a Kinde of Vermine. <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> anſwers to the <hi>Theologicall Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue Charitie,</hi> and admits no Exceſſe, but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:176830:40"/>Errour. The deſire of Power in Exceſſe, cauſed the Angels to fall; The deſire of Knowledge in Exceſſe, cauſed Man to fall; But in <hi>Charity,</hi> there is no Exceſſe; Neither can Angell, or Man, come in danger by it. The Inclination to <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> is imprinted deepely in the Nature of Man: In ſo much, that if it iſſue not towards Men, it will take vnto Other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Creatures: As it is ſeen in the Turks, a Cruell People, who neuertheleſſe, are kinde to Beaſts, and giue Almes to Dogs, and Birds: In ſo much, as <hi>Busbechius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth; A Chriſtian Boy in <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> had like to haue been ſtoned, for gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, in a waggiſhneſſe, a long Billed Fowle. Errours, indeed, in this vertue of <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> may be committed. The <hi>Italians</hi> haue an vngracious Prouerb; <hi>Tanto buon che val niente: So good, that he is good for nothing.</hi> And one of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Italy, Nicholas Macciauel,</hi> had the confidence to put in writing, almoſt in plaine Termes: <hi>That the Chriſtian Faith, had giuen vp Good Men, in prey, to thoſe,

Therfore to auoid the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, and the Danger both; it is good to take knowledge, of the Errours, of an Habit, ſo excellent. Seeke the Good of other Men, but be not in bondage, to their Faces, or Fancies, For that is but Facilitie, or Softneſſe; which taketh an honeſt Minde Priſoner. Neither giue thou <hi>Aeſops</hi> Cocke a Gemme, who would be better pleaſed, and happier, if he had had a Barly Corne. The Example of God teacheth the Leſſon truly: <hi>He ſendeth his Raine, and maketh his Sunne to ſhine, vpon the Iuſt, and Vniuſt;</hi> But hee doth not raine Wealth, nor ſhine Honour, and Vertues, vpon Men equally. Common Benefits, are to be communicate with all; But peculiar Benefits, with choice. And beware, how in making the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture, thou breakeſt the Patterne: For Diuinitie maketh the Loue of our Selues
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:176830:41"/>the Patterne; The Loue of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours but the Portraiture. <hi>Sell all thou haſt, and giue it to the poore, and follow mee:</hi> But ſell not all thou haſt, except thou come, and follow mee; That is, except thou haue a Vocation, wherin thou maiſt doe as much good, with little meanes, as with great: For otherwiſe, in feeding the Streames, thou drieſt the Fountaine. Neither is there only a <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> directed by right Reaſon; but there is, in ſome Men, euen in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Diſpoſition towards it: As on the other ſide, there is a Naturall Malignitie. For there be, that in their Nature, doe not affect the Good of Others. The lighter Sort of Malignitie, turneth but to a Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or Frowardneſſe, or Aprneſſe to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or Difficilneſſe, or the like; but the deeper Sort, to Enuy, and meere Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. Such Men, in other mens Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, are, as it were, in ſeaſon, and are euer on the loading Part; Not ſo good as the Dogs, that licked <hi>Lazarus</hi> Sores; but like Flies, that are ſtill buzzing, vpon

Such Diſpoſitions, are the very Errours of Humane Nature: And yet they are the fitteſt Timber, to make great Politiques of Like to knee Timber, that is good for Ships, that are ordained, to be toſſed; But not for Building houſes, that ſhall ſtand firme. The Parts and Signes of <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> are many. If a Man be Gracious, and Curteous to Strangers, it ſhewes, he is a Citizen of the World; And that his Heart, is no Iſland, cut off from other Lands; but a Continent, that ioynes to them. If he be Compaſſionate, towards the Afflictions of others, it ſhewes that his Heart is like the noble Tree, that is wounded it ſelfe, when it giues the Balme. If he eaſily Pardons and Remits Offences, it ſhews, that his Minde is planted aboue Iniuries; So that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſhot. If he be Thankfull for ſmall Benefits, it ſhewes, that he weighes Mens

            <p>Alſo, as <hi>Macciauel</hi> noteth well; when Princes, that ought to be Common Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, make themſelues as a Party, and leane to a ſide, it is as a Boat that is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, by vneuen weight, on the one Side; As was well ſeen, in the time of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the third of <hi>France.</hi> For firſt, himſelfe entred League for the Extirpation of the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and preſently after, the ſame League was turned vpon Himſelfe.

            <p>Alſo, when Diſcords, and Quarrells, and Factions, are carried openly, and audaciouſly; it is a Signe, the Reuerence of Gouernment is loſt. For the Motions of the greateſt perſons, in a Gouernment, ought to be, as the Motions of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, vnder <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> (according to the old Opinion:) which is, That Euery of them, is carried ſwiftly, by the Higheſt Motion, and ſoftly in their owne Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therfore, when great Ones, in their owne particular Motion, moue vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> expreſſeth it well, <hi>Liberiùs, quàm vt Imperantium meminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;</hi> It is a Signe, the Orbs are out of Frame.

            </p>
            <p>So when any of the foure Pillars of Gouernment, are mainly ſhaken, or
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:176830:47"/>weakned (which are <hi>Religion, Iuſtice, Counſell,</hi> and <hi>Treaſure,</hi>) Men had need to pray for Faire Weather.

            <p>Concerning the <hi>Materialls</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi> It is a Thing well to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: For the ſureſt way to preuent <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> (if the Times doe beare it,) is to take away the <hi>Matter</hi> of them.

For the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of the Belly are the worſt. As for <hi>Diſcontentments,</hi> they are in the Politique Body, like to Humours in the Naturall, which are apt to gather a preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Heat, and to Enflame. And let no Prince meaſure the Danger of them, by this; whether they be luſt, or Vniuſt? For that were to imagine People to be too reaſonable; who doe often ſpurne at their owne Good: Nor yet by this; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Griefes, wherupon they riſe, be in fact, great or ſmall: For they are the moſt dangerous <hi>Diſcontentments,</hi> where the Feare is greater then the Feeling. <hi>Dolendi Modus, Timendi non item.</hi> Beſides, in great Oppreſſions, the ſame Things, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:176830:48"/>the Patience, doe withall mate the Courage: But in Feares it is not ſo. Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let any Prince, or State, be ſecure concerning <hi>Diſcontentments,</hi> becauſe they haue been often, or haue been long and yet no Perill hath enſued; For as it is true, that euery Vapor, or Fume, doth not turne into a Storme; So it is, neuertheleſſe, true, that Stormes, though they blow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer diuers times, yet may fall at laſt; And as the Spaniſh Prouerb noteth well; <hi>The cord breaketh at the laſt by the weakeſt pull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Motiues</hi> of <hi>Seditions</hi> are; <hi>Innouation</hi> in <hi>Religion; Taxes; Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Lawes and Cuſtomes; Breaking of Priuiledges; Generall Oppreſsion; Aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vnworthy perſons; Strangers; Dearths; Disbanded Souldiers; Factions growne deſperate;</hi> And whatſoeuer in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending People, ioyneth and knitteth them, in a Common Cauſe.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Remedies;</hi> There may be ſome generall Preſeruatiues, whereof wee will ſpeake; As for the iuſt Cure, it muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:176830:48"/>to the Particular Diſeaſe: And ſo be left to Counſell, rather then Rule.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Remedy</hi> or preuention, is to remoue by all meanes poſſible, that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Sedition,</hi> wherof we ſpake; which is <hi>Want</hi> and <hi>Pouerty</hi> in the <hi>Eſtate.</hi> To which purpoſe, ſerueth the Opening, and well Ballancing of Trade; The Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of Manufactures; the Baniſhing of Idleneſſe; the Repreſſing of waſte and Exceſſe by Sumptuary Lawes; the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement and Husbanding of the Soyle; the Regulating of Prices of things vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the Moderating of Taxes and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; And the like. Generally, it is to be foreſeene, that the Population of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (eſpecially if it be not mowen downe by warrs) doe not exceed, the Stock of the Kingdome, which ſhould maintaine them. Neither is the Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be reckoned, onely by number: For a ſmaller Number, that ſpend more, and earneleſſe, doe weare out an Eſtate, ſooner then a greater Number, that liue lower, and gather more.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:176830:49"/>Multiplying of Nobilitie, and other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Qualitie, in an ouer Proportion, to the Common People, doth ſpeedily bring a State to Neceſſitie: And ſo doth likewiſe an ouergrowne Clergie; For they bring nothing to the Stocke; And in like manner, when more are bred Schollers, then Preferments can take off.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe to be remembred, that for as much as the increaſe of any Eſtate, muſt be vpon the Forrainer, (for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is ſome where gotten, is ſome where loſt) There be but three Things, which one Nation ſelleth vnto another; The <hi>Commoditie</hi> as Nature yeeldeth it; The <hi>Manufacture;</hi> and the <hi>Vecture</hi> or <hi>Carriage.</hi> So that if theſe three wheeles goe, Wealth will flow as in a Spring tide. And it commeth many times to paſſe, that <hi>Materiam ſuperabit Opus;</hi> That the Worke, and Carriage, is more worth, then the Materiall, and enricheth a State more; As is notably ſeene in the <hi>Low-Countrey-men,</hi> who haue the beſt Mines, aboue ground, in the World.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:176830:49"/>
            <p> Aboue all things, good Policie is to be vſed, that the Treaſure and Moneyes, in a State, be not gathered into few Hands. For otherwiſe, a State may haue a great Stock, and yet ſtarue. And Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is like Muck, not good except it be ſpread. This is done, chiefly, by ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or at the leaſt, keeping a ſtrait Hand, vpon the Deuouring Trades of <hi>Vſurie, Ingroſsing,</hi> great <hi>Paſturages,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>For Remouing <hi>Diſcontentments,</hi> or at leaſt, the danger of them; There is in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry State (as we know) two Portions of <hi>Subiects;</hi> The <hi>Nobleſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> When one of theſe is <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> the danger is not great; For Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are of ſlow Motion, if they be not excited, by the Greater Sort; And the Greater Sort are of ſmall ſtrength, except the Multitude, be apt and ready, to moue of themſelues. Then is the danger, when the Greater Sort doe but wait for the Troubling of the Waters, amongſt the Meaner, that then they may declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The Poets faigne, that the reſt of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:176830:50"/>the Gods, would haue bound <hi>Iupiter;</hi> which he hearing of, by the Counſell of <hi>Pallas,</hi> ſent for <hi>Briareus,</hi> with his hundred Hands, to come in to his Aid. An Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme, no doubt, to ſhew, how ſafe it is for Monarchs, to make ſure of the good Will of Common People.</p>
            <p>To giue moderate Liberty, for Griefes, and <hi>Diſcontentments</hi> to euaporate, (ſo it be without too great Inſolency or Brauery) is a ſafe Way. For he that turneth the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors backe, and maketh the Wound bleed inwards, endangereth maligne Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and pernicious Impoſtumations.</p>
            <p>The Part of <hi>Epimetheus,</hi> mought well become <hi>Prometheus,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments;</hi> For there is not a better proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt them. <hi>Epimetheus,</hi> when Griefes and Euils flew abroad, at laſt ſhut the lid, and kept Hope in the Bottome of the Veſſell. Certainly, the Politique and Artificiall Nouriſhing, and Entertaining of <hi>Hopes,</hi> and Carrying Men from <hi>Hopes</hi> to <hi>Hopes;</hi> is one of the beſt Antidotes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Poyſon of <hi>Diſcontentments.</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:176830:50"/>And it is a certaine Signe, of a wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and Proceeding, when it can hold Mens hearts by <hi>Hopes,</hi> when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by Satisfaction: And when it can handle things, in ſuch manner, as no Euill ſhall appeare ſo peremptory, but that it hath ſome Out let of <hi>Hope:</hi> Which is the leſſe hard to doe, becauſe both particular Perſons, and Factions, are apt enough to flatter themſelues, or at leaſt to braue that, which they beleeue not.</p>
            <p>Alſo, the Foreſight, and Preuention, that there be no likely or fit Head, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>Diſcontented Perſons</hi> may reſort, and vnder whom they may ioyne, is a knowne, but an excellent Point of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I vnderſtand a fit Head, to be one, that hath Greatneſſe, &amp; Reputation; That hath Confidence with the <hi>Diſcontented Party;</hi> and vpon whom they turne their Eyes; And that is thought <hi>diſcontented</hi> in his own particular; which kinde of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are either to be wonne, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the State, and that in a faſt and true manner; Or to be fronted, with ſome
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:176830:51"/>other, of the ſame Party, that may oppoſe them, and ſo diuide the reputation. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, the Diuiding and Breaking of all Factions, and Combinations that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe to the State, and ſetting them at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or at leaſt diſtruſt amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, is not one of the worſt <hi>Remedies.</hi> For it is a deſperate Caſe, if thoſe, that hold with the Proceeding of the State, be full of Diſcord and Faction; And thoſe that are againſt it, be entire and vnited.</p>
            <p>I haue noted, that ſome witty and ſharpe Speeches, which haue fallen from <hi>Princes,</hi> haue giuen fire to <hi>Seditions. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> did himſelfe infinite Hurt, in that Speech; <hi>Sylla neſciuit Literas, non potuit dictare:</hi> For it did, vtterly, cut off that <hi>Hope,</hi> which Men had entertained, that he would, at one time or other, giue ouer his Dictatorſhip. <hi>Galba</hi> vndid himſelfe by that Speech; <hi>Legi à ſe Militem, non emi:</hi> For it put the Souldiers, out of Hope, of the Donatiue. <hi>Probus</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by that Speech; <hi>Si vixero, non

Surely, <hi>Princes</hi> had need, in tender Matters, and Tickliſh Times, to beware what they ſay; Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in theſe ſhort Speeches, which flie abroad like Darts, and are thought to be ſhot out of their ſecret Intentions. For as for large Diſcourſes, they are flat Things, and not ſo much noted.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, let Princes, againſt all Euents, not be without ſome Great Perſon, one, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more, of Military Valour neere vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the Repreſſing of <hi>Seditions,</hi> in their beginnings.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:176830:58"/>let him change his Lodging, from one End and Part of the Towne, to another; which is a great Adamant of Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Let him ſequeſter himſelfe from the Company of his Country men, and diet in ſuch Places, where there is good Company of the Nation, where he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth. Let him vpon his Remoues, from one place to another, procure Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, to ſome perſon of Quality, reſiding in the Place, whither he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth; that he may vſe his Fauour, in thoſe things, he deſireth to ſee or know. Thus he may abridge his <hi>Trauaile,</hi> with much profit. As for the acquaintance, which is to be ſought in <hi>Trauaile;</hi> That which is moſt of all profitable, is Acquaintance with the Secretaries, and Employd Men of Ambaſſadours; For ſo in <hi>Trauailing</hi> in one Country he ſhall ſucke the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of many. Let him alſo ſee and viſit, Eminent Perſons, in all Kindes, which are of great Name abroad; That he may be able to tell, how the Life agreeth with the Fame. For Quarels, they are with
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:176830:59"/>Care and Diſcretion to be auoided: They are, commonly, for Miſtreſſes; Healths; Place; and Words. And let a Man beware, how he keepeth Company, with Cholerick and Quarelſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for they will engage him into their owne Quarels. When a <hi>Trauailer</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth home, let him not leaue the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where he hath <hi>Trauailed,</hi> altogether behinde him; But maintaine a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by letters, with thoſe of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, which are of moſt Worth. And let his <hi>Trauaile</hi> appeare rather in his Diſcourſe, then in his Apparrell, or Geſture: And in his Diſcourſe, let him be rather aduiſed in his Anſwers, then forwards to tell Stories: And let it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that he doth not change his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Manners, for thoſe of Forraigne Parts; But onely, prick in ſome Flowers, of that he hath Learned abroad, into the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of his owne Country.</p>

               <hi>Princes,</hi> many times, make themſelues Deſires, and ſet their Hearts vpon toyes: Sometimes vpon a Building; Sometimes vpon Erecting of an Order; Sometimes vpon the Aduancing of a Perſon; Sometimes vpon obtaining Excellency in ſome Art, or Feat of the Hand; As <hi>Nero</hi> for playing on the Harpe, <hi>Domitian</hi> for Certainty of the Hand with the Arrow, <hi>Commodus</hi> for playing at Fence, <hi>Caracalla</hi> for driuing Chariots, and the like. This ſeemeth incredible vnto thoſe, that know not the Principle; <hi>That the Minde of Man is more cheared, and refreſhed, by profiting in ſmall things, then by ſtanding at a ſtay in great.</hi> We ſee alſo that <hi>Kings,</hi> that haue beene fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Conquerours in their firſt yeares; it being not poſſible for them to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward infinitely, but that they muſt haue ſome Checke or Arreſt in their Fortunes; turne in their latter yeares, to be Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and Melancholy: As did <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great; <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> And in our memory, <hi>Charles</hi> the fift; And others:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:176830:60"/>For he that is vſed to goe forward, and findeth a Stop, falleth out of his owne fauour, and is not the Thing he was.</p>
            <p>To ſpeake now of the true Temper of <hi>Empire:</hi> It is a Thing rare, &amp; hard to keep: For both Temper &amp; Diſtemper conſiſt of Contraries. But it is one thing to mingle Contraries, another to enterchange them. The Anſwer of <hi>Apollonius</hi> to <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> is full of Excellent Inſtruction; <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> asked him; <hi>What was Neroes ouerthrow?</hi> He anſwered; <hi>Nero could touch and tune the Harpe well; But in Gouernment, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he vſed to winde the pins too high, ſometimes to let them downe too low.</hi> And certaine it is, that Nothing deſtroieth Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſo much, as the vnequall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Enterchange of Power <hi>Preſſed</hi> too farre, and <hi>Relaxed</hi> too much.</p>
            <p>This is true; that the wiſdome of all theſe latter Times in <hi>Princes</hi> Affaires, is rather fine Deliueries, and Shiftings of Dangers and Miſchiefes, when they are neare; then ſolid and grounded Courſes to keepe them aloofe. But this is but to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:176830:61"/>try Maſteries with Fortune: And let men beware, how they neglect, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Matter of Trouble, to be prepared: For no Man can forbid the Sparke, nor tell whence it may come. The difficulties in <hi>Princes</hi> Buſineſſe, are many and great; But the greateſt difficulty, is often in their owne Minde. For it is common with <hi>Princes,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tacitus</hi>) to will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories. <hi>Sunt plerum<expan>

            <p>Firſt for their <hi>Neighbours;</hi> There can no generall Rule be giuen, (The Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are ſo variable,) ſaue one; which euer holdeth; which is, That <hi>Princes</hi> doe

And this is, generally, the work of Standing Counſels to foreſee; and to hinder it. During that <hi>Triumuirate</hi> of <hi>Kings, King Henry</hi> the 8. of <hi>England, Francis</hi> the 1. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. <hi>Emperour,</hi> there was ſuch a watch kept, that none of the Three, could win a Palme of Ground, but the other two, would ſtraightwaies ballance it, either by Confederation, or, if need were, by a Warre: And would not, in any wiſe, take vp Peace at Intereſt. And the like was done by that League (which, <hi>Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardine</hi> ſaith, was the Security of <hi>Italy</hi>) made betwene <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; Lorenzius Medices,</hi> and <hi>Ludouicus Sforza, Potentates,</hi> the one of <hi>Florence,</hi> the other of <hi>Millaine.</hi> Neither is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, of ſome of the Schoole-Men, to be receiued; <hi>That a warre cannot iuſtly be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:176830:62"/>made, but vpon a precedent Iniury, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation.</hi> For there is no Queſtion, but a iuſt Feare, of an Imminent danger, though there be no Blow giuen, is a lawfull Cauſe of a Warre.</p>
            <p>For their <hi>Wiues;</hi> There are Cruell Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of them. <hi>Liuia</hi> is infamed for the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of her husband: <hi>Roxolana, Solymans</hi> Wife, was the deſtruction, of that renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prince, <hi>Sultan Muſtapha,</hi> And other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe troubled his Houſe, and Succeſſion: <hi>Edward</hi> the Second of <hi>England,</hi> his Queen, had the principall hand, in the Depoſing and Murther of her Husband. This kinde of danger, is then to be feared, chiefly, when the <hi>Wiues</hi> haue Plots, for the Raiſing of their owne Children; Or elſe that they be Aduoutreſſes.</p>
            <p>For their <hi>Children:</hi> The Tragedies, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, of dangers from them, haue been many. And generally, the Entring of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, into Suſpicion of their <hi>Children,</hi> hath been euer vnfortunate. The deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> (that we named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) was ſo fatall to <hi>Solymans</hi> Line, as
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:176830:62"/>the Succeſſion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> from <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> vntill this day, is ſuſpected to be vntrue, and of ſtrange Bloud; For that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymus</hi> the Second was thought to be Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious. The deſtruction of <hi>Criſpus,</hi> a young Prince, of rare Towardneſſe, by <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> the Great, his Father, was in like manner fatall to his Houſe; For both <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> and <hi>Conſtance,</hi> his Sonnes, died violent deaths; And <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his other Sonne, did little better; who died, indeed, of Sickneſſe, but after that <hi>Iulia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> had taken Armes againſt him. The deſtruction of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Sonne to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the Second, of <hi>Macedon,</hi> turned vpon the Father, who died of Repentance. And many like Examples there are: But few, or none, where the Fathers had good by ſuch diſtruſt; Except it were, where the Sonnes were vp, in open Armes againſt them; As was <hi>Selymus</hi> the firſt againſt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iazet:</hi> And the three Sonnes of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, King of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For their <hi>Prelates;</hi> when they are proud and great, there is alſo danger from them:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:176830:63"/>As it was, in the times of <hi>Anſelmus,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> who with their Croſiars, did almoſt try it, with the Kings Sword; And yet they had to deale with Stout and Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Kings; <hi>William Rufus, Henry</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond. The danger is not from that <hi>State,</hi> but where it hath a dependance of forraine Authority; Or where the Churchmen come in, and are elected, not by the Collation of the King, or particular Patrons, but by the People.</p>
            <p>For their <hi>Nobles;</hi> To keepe them at a diſtance, it is not amiſſe; But to depreſſe them, may make a King more Abſolute, but leſſe Safe; And leſſe able to performe any thing, that he deſires. I haue noted it, in my Hiſtory of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, of <hi>England,</hi> who depreſſed his <hi>Nobility;</hi> Whereupon, it came to paſſe, that his Times were full of Difficulties, &amp; Troubles; For the <hi>Nobility,</hi> though they continued loyall vnto him, yet did they not co-operate with him, in his Buſineſſe.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:176830:63"/>So that in effect, he was faine to doe all things, himſelfe.</p>
            <p>For their <hi>Second Nobles;</hi> There is not much danger from them, being a Body diſperſed. They may ſometimes diſcourſe high, but that doth little Hurt: Beſides, they are a Counterpoize to the Higher <hi>Nobility,</hi> that they grow not too Potent: And laſtly, being the moſt immediate in Authority, with the Common People, they doe beſt temper Popular Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>For their <hi>Merchants;</hi> They are <hi>Vena por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;</hi> And if they flouriſh not, a Kingdome may haue good Limmes, but will haue empty Veines, and nouriſh little. Taxes, and Impoſts vpon them, doe ſeldome good to the <hi>Kings</hi> Reuenew; For that that he winnes in the Hundred, he leeſeth in the Shire; The particular Rates being increaſed, but the totall Bulke of Trading rather decreaſed.</p>
            <p>For their <hi>Commons;</hi> There is little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from them, except it be, where they haue Great and Potent Heads; Or where
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:176830:64"/>you meddle, with the Point of Religion; Or their Cuſtomes, or Meanes of Life.</p>
            <p>For their <hi>Men of warre;</hi> It is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous State, where they liue and remaine in a Body, and are vſed to Donatiues; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſee Examples in the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> and <hi>Pretorian</hi> Bands of <hi>Rome:</hi> But Traynings of Men, and Arming them in ſeuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and vnder ſeuerall Commanders, and without Donatiues, are Things of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and no Danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Princes</hi> are like to <hi>Heauenly Bodies,</hi> which cauſe good or euill times; And which haue much <hi>Veneration,</hi> but no <hi>Reſt.</hi> All precepts concerning <hi>Kings,</hi> are in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect comprehended, in thoſe two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances: <hi>Memento quod es Homo;</hi> And <hi>Memento quod es Deus,</hi> or <hi>Vice Dei:</hi> The one bridleth their Power, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Will.</p>

            <p>Let vs now ſpeake of the <hi>Inconueniences</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:176830:66"/>of <hi>Counſell,</hi> and of the <hi>Remedies.</hi> The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences,</hi> that haue been noted in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and vſing Counſell, are three.

            <p>As to <hi>Secrecy; Princes</hi> are not bound to communicate all Matters, with all <hi>Counſellors;</hi> but may extract and ſelect. Neither is it neceſſary, that he that conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth what he ſhould doe, ſhould declare what he will doe.

And as for <hi>Cabinet Counſels,</hi> it may be their <hi>Motto; Plenus rimarum ſum:</hi> One futile perſon, that maketh it his glory to tell, will doe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:176830:66"/>more hurt, then many, that know it their duty to conceale. It is true, there be ſome Affaires, which require extreme <hi>Secrecy,</hi> which will hardly go beyond one or two perſons, beſides the <hi>King:</hi> Neither are thoſe <hi>Counſels</hi> vnproſperous: For beſides the <hi>Secrecy,</hi> they commonly goe on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in one Spirit of Direction, without diſtraction.

            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Weakening of Authority;</hi> The Fable ſheweth the <hi>Remedy.</hi> Nay the Maieſty of Kings, is rather exalted, then diminiſhed, when they are in the Chaire of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: Neither was there euer <hi>Prince,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued of his Dependances, by his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell;</hi> Except where there hath beene, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:176830:67"/>an Ouergreatneſſe in one <hi>Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi> Or an Ouerſtrict Combination in Diuers; which are Things ſoone found, and holpen.</p>
            <p>For the laſt <hi>Inconuenience,</hi> that Men will <hi>Counſell with an Eye to themſelues;</hi> Certainly, <hi>Non inueniet Fidem ſuper ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> is meant of the Nature of Times, and not of all particular Perſons; There be, that are in Nature, Faithfull, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and Plaine, and Direct; Not Crafty, and Inuolued: Let <hi>Princes,</hi> aboue all, draw to themſelues ſuch Natures. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Counſellours</hi> are not Commonly ſo vnited, but that one <hi>Counſellour</hi> keepeth Centinell ouer Another; So that if any do <hi>Counſell</hi> out of Faction, or priuate Ends, it commonly comes to the <hi>Kings</hi> Eare. But the beſt <hi>Remedy</hi> is, if <hi>Princes</hi> know their <hi>Counſellours,</hi> as well as their <hi>Counſellours</hi> know Them:
<q>Principis efl Virtus maxima noſſe ſuos.</q> And on the other ſide, <hi>Counſellours</hi> ſhould not be too Speculatiue, into their Soueraignes Perſon. The true Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:176830:67"/>of a <hi>Counſellour,</hi> is rather to be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their Maſters Buſineſſe, then in his Nature; For then he is like to Aduiſe him, and not to Feede his Humour. It is of ſingular vſe to <hi>Princes,</hi> if they take the Opinions of their <hi>Counſell,</hi> both Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and Together. For Priuate Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is more free; but Opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others is more Reuerend.

It is in vaine for <hi>Princes</hi> to take <hi>Counſel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Matters,</hi> if they take no <hi>Counſell</hi> likewiſe concerning Perſons: For all <hi>Matters,</hi> are as dead Images; And the Life of the Execution of Affaires, reſteth in the good Choice of <hi>Perſons.</hi> Neither is it enough to conſult concerning <hi>Perſons, Secundum genera,</hi> as in an <hi>Idea,</hi> or <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Deſcription,</hi> what the Kinde and

            <p>The <hi>Counſels,</hi> at this Day, in moſt Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are but Familiar Meetings; where Matters are rather talked on, then deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſet Daies for Petitions: For both it giues the Suitors more certainty for their Attendance; And it frees the Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for Matters of Eſtate, that they may <hi>Hoc agere.</hi> In choice of Committees, for

I commend alſo <hi>ſtanding Commiſsions;</hi> As for Trade; for Treaſure; for Warre; for Suits; for ſome Prouinces: For where there be diuers particular <hi>Counſels,</hi> and but one <hi>Counſell</hi> of Eſtate, (as it is in <hi>Spaine</hi>) they are in effect no more, then <hi>Standing Commiſsions;</hi> Saue that they haue greater Authority. Let ſuch, as are to informe <hi>Counſels,</hi> out of their particular Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (as Lawyers, Sea-men, Mint-men, and the like) be firſt heard, before <hi>Committees;</hi> And then, as Occaſion ſerues, before the <hi>Counſell.</hi> And let them not come in Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, or in a Tribunitious Manner; For that is, to clamour <hi>Counſels,</hi> not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them. A long Table, and a ſquare Table, or Seats about the Walls, ſeeme Things of Forme, but are Things of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; For at a long Table, a few at the vpper end, in effect, ſway all the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; But in the other Forme, there is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:176830:69"/>more vſe of the <hi>Counſellours</hi> Opinions, that ſit lower. A <hi>King,</hi> when he preſides in <hi>Counſell,</hi> let him beware how he Opens his owne Inclination too much, in that which he propoundeth: For elſe <hi>Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours</hi> will but take the Winde of him; And in ſtead of giuing Free Counſell, ſing him a Song of <hi>Placebo.</hi>

There is ſurely no greater Wiſedome, then well to time the Beginnings, and Oaſets of Things. Dangers are no more light, if they once ſeeme light: And more dangers haue deceiued Men, then forced them. Nay, it were better, to meet ſome Dangers halfe way, though they come nothing

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E take <hi>Cunning</hi> for a Sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Crooked Wiſedome. And certainly, there is great difference, between a <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> Man, and a <hi>Wiſe</hi> Man; Not onely in Point of Honeſty, but in point of Ability. There be that can packe the Cards, and yet cannot play well; So there are ſome, that are good in Canuaſſes, and Factions, that are otherwiſe Weake Men. Againe, it is one thing to vnderſtand Perſons, and another thing to vnderſtand Matters; For many are perfect in Mens Humours, that are not greatly Capable of the Reall Part of Buſineſſe; Which is the Conſtitution of one, that hath ſtudied Men, more then Bookes. Such Men are fitter for Practiſe, then for Counſell; And they are good but in their own Alley: Turne them to New
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:176830:71"/>Men, and they haue loſt their Ayme; So as the old Rule, to know a Foole from a Wiſe Man; <hi>Mitte ambos nudos ad ignotos, &amp; videbis;</hi> doth ſcarce hold for them. And becauſe theſe <hi>Cunning Men,</hi> are like Haberdaſhers of Small Wares, it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe to ſet forth their Shop.</p>
            <p>It is a point of <hi>Cunning;</hi> to wait vpon him, with whom you ſpeake, with your eye; As the Ieſuites giue it in precept: For there be many Wiſe Men, that haue Secret Hearts, and Tranſparant Countenances. Yet this would be done, with a demure Abaſing of your Eye ſometimes, as the Ieſuites alſo doe vſe.</p>
            <p>Another is, that when you haue any thing to obtaine of preſent diſpatch, you entertaine, and amuſe the party, with whom you deale, with ſome other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; That he be not too much awake, to make Obiections. I knew a <hi>Counſellor</hi> and <hi>Secretary,</hi> that neuer came to <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> with Bills to ſigne, but he would alwaies firſt put her into ſome diſcourſe of Eſtate, that ſhe mought
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:176830:71"/>the leſſe minde the Bills.</p>
            <p>The like Surprize, may be made, by Mouing things, when the Party is in haſte, and cannot ſtay, to conſider adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, of that is moued.</p>
            <p>If a man would croſſe a Buſineſſe, that he doubts ſome other would handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually moue, let him pretend to wiſh it well, and moue it himſelfe, in ſuch ſort, as may foile it.</p>
            <p>The breaking off, in the midſt of that, one was about to ſay, as if he tooke himſelfe vp, breeds a greater Appetite in him, with whom you conferre, to know more.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it workes better, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſeemeth to be gotten from you by Queſtion, then if you offer it of your ſelfe, you may lay a Bait for a Queſtion, by ſhewing another Viſage and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, then you are wont; To the end, to giue Occaſion, for the party to aske, what the Matter is of the Change? As <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> did; <hi>And I had not before that time been ſad before the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:176830:72"/>
            <p> In Things, that are tender and vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, it is good to breake the Ice, by ſome whoſe Words are of leſſe weight, and to reſerue the more weighty Voice, to come in, as by chance, ſo that he may be asked the Queſtion vpon the others Speech. As <hi>Narciſſus</hi> did, in relating to <hi>Claudius,</hi> the Marriage of <hi>Meſſalina</hi> and <hi>Silius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In things, that a Man would not be ſeen in, himſelfe; It is a Point of <hi>Cunning,</hi> to borrow the Name of the World; As to ſay; <hi>The World ſayes,</hi> Or, <hi>There is a ſpeech abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I knew one, that when he wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he would put that which was moſt Materiall, in the <hi>Pofl-ſcript,</hi> as if it had been a By-matter.</p>
            <p>I knew another, that when he came to haue Speech, he would paſſe ouer that, that he intended moſt, and goe forth, and come backe againe, and ſpeake of it, as of a Thing, that he had almoſt forgot.</p>
            <p>Some procure themſelues, to be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, at ſuch times, as it is like, the party that they work vpon, will ſuddenly come
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:176830:72"/>vpon them: And to be found with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in their hand, or doing ſomewhat which they are not accuſtomed; To the end, they may be appoſed of thoſe things, which of themſelues they are deſirous to vtter.</p>
            <p>It is a Point of <hi>Cunning,</hi> to let fall thoſe Words, in a Mans owne Name, which he would haue another Man learne, and vſe, and thereupon take Aduantage. I knew two, that were Competitors, for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries Place, in <hi>Queene Elizabeths</hi> time, and yet kept good Quarter betweene themſelues; And would conferre, one with another, vpon the Buſineſſe; And the one of them ſaid, That to be a Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, in the <hi>Declination of a Monarchy,</hi> was a Tickliſh Thing, and that he did not affect it: The other, ſtraight caught vp thoſe Words, and diſcourſed with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his Friends, that he had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to deſire to be Secretary, in the <hi>Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Monarchy.</hi> The firſt Man tooke hold of it, and found Meanes, it was told the <hi>Queene;</hi> Who hearing of a <hi>Declination
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:176830:73"/>of a Monarchy,</hi> tooke it ſo ill, as ſhe would neuer after heare of the others Suit.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Cunning,</hi> which we in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> call, <hi>The Turning of the Cat in the Pan;</hi> which is, when that which a Man ſayes to another, he laies it, as if Another had ſaid it to him. And to ſay Truth, it is not eaſie, when ſuch a Matter paſſed between two, to make it appeare, from which of them, it firſt moued and began.</p>
            <p>It is a way, that ſome men haue, to glaunce and dart at Others, by Iuſtifying themſelues, by Negatiues; As to ſay, <hi>This I doe not:</hi> As <hi>Tigillinus</hi> did towards <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus; Se non diuerſas ſpes, ſed Incolumitatem Imperatoris ſimpliciter ſpectare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some haue in readineſſe, ſo many Tales and Stories, as there is Nothing, they would inſinuate, but they can wrap it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Tale; which ſcrueth both to keepe themſelues more in Guard, and to make others carry it, with more Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>It is a good Point of <hi>Cunning,</hi> for a Man, to ſhape the Anſwer he would haue, in his owne Words, and Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:176830:73"/>For it makes the other Party ſticke the leſſe.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange, how long ſome Men will lie in wait, to ſpeake ſomewhat, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſay, And how farre about they will fetch; And how many other Matters they will beat ouer, to come neare it. It is a Thing of great Patience, but yet of much Vſe.</p>
            <p>A ſudden, bold, and vnexpected Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, doth many times ſurpriſe a Man, and lay him open. Like to him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing changed his Name, and walking in <hi>Pauls,</hi> Another ſuddenly came behind him, and called him by his true Name, whereat ſtraightwaies he looked backe.</p>
            <p>But theſe Small Wares, and Petty Points of <hi>Cunning,</hi> are infinite: And it were a good deed, to make a Liſt of them: For that nothing doth more hurt in a State, then that <hi>Cunning Men</hi> paſſe for <hi>Wiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But certainly, ſome there are, that know the Reſorts and Falls of Buſineſſe, that cannot ſinke into the Maine of it: Like a Houſe, that hath conuenient Staires, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:176830:74"/>Entries, but neuer a faire Roome. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you ſhall ſee them finde out pretty Looſes in the Concluſion, but are no waies able to Examine, or debate Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And yet commonly they take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of their Inability, and would be thought Wits of direction. Some build rather vpon the Abuſing of others, and (as we now ſay;) <hi>Putting Tricks vpon them;</hi> Then vpon Soundneſſe of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.

It were diſproportion enough, for the Seruants Good, to be preferred before the Maſters; But yet it is a greater Extreme, when a little Good of the Seruant, ſhall carry Things, againſt a great Good of the Maſters. And yet that is the caſe of Bad Officers, Treaſurers, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, Generals, and other Falſe and Corrupt Seruants; which ſet a Bias vpon their Bowle, of their owne Petty Ends, and Enuies, to the ouerthrow of their

And for the moſt part, the Good ſuch Seruants receiue, is after the Modell of their own Fortune; But the Hurt they ſell for that Good, is after the Modell of their Maſters Fortune. And certainly, it is the Nature of Extreme <hi>Selfe-Louers;</hi> As they will ſet an Houſe on Fire, and it were but to roaſt their Egges: And yet theſe Men, many times, hold credit with their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; Becauſe their Study is but to pleaſe Them, and profit <hi>Themſelues:</hi> And for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect, they will abandon the Good of their Affaires.</p>

               <hi>AFected Diſpatch,</hi> is one of the moſt dangerous things to Buſineſſe that can be. It is like that, which the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians call <hi>Predigeſtion,</hi> or <hi>Haſty Digeſtion;</hi> which is ſure to fill the Body, full of Crudities, and ſecret Seeds of Diſeaſes. Therefore, meaſure not <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch,</hi> by the Times of Sitting, but by the Aduancement of the Buſineſſe. And as in Races, it is not the large Stride, or High Lift, that makes the Speed: So in Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Keeping cloſe to the matter, and not Taking of it too much at once, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth <hi>Diſpatch.</hi> It is the Care of Some, onely to come off ſpeedily, for the time; Or to contriue ſome falſe Periods of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, becauſe they may ſeeme <hi>Men of Diſpatch.</hi> But it is one Thing, to Abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiate

For Time is the meaſure of Buſineſſe, as Money is of Wares: And Buſineſſe is bought at a deare Hand, where there is ſmall <hi>diſpatch.</hi> The <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> haue been noted to be of Small <hi>diſpatch; Mi venga la Muerte de Spagna; Let my Death come from Spaine;</hi> For then it will be ſure to be long in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
            <p>Giue good Hearing to thoſe, that giue the firſt Information in Buſineſſe; And rather direct them in the beginning, then interrupt them in the continuance of their Speeches: for he that is put out of his owne Order, will goe forward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and be more tedious while he waits
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:176830:79"/>vpon his Memory, then he could haue been, if he had gone on, in his owne courſe. But ſometimes it is ſeene, that the Moderator is more troubleſome, then the Actor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iterations</hi> are commonly loſſe of Time: But there is no ſuch Gaine of Time, as to <hi>iterate</hi> often the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Queſtion:</hi> For it chaſeth away many a Friuolous Speech, as it is comming forth. Long and Curious Speeches, are as fit for <hi>Diſpatch,</hi> as a Robe or Mantle with a long Traine, is for Race. Prefaces, and Paſſages, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, and other Speeches of Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Perſon, are great waſts of Time; And though they ſeeme to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed of Modeſty, they are Brauery. Yet beware of being too Materiall, when there is any Impediment or Obſtruction in Mens Wils; For Pre-occupation of Minde, euer requireth preface of Speech; Like a Fomentation to make the vnguent enter.</p>
            <p>Aboue all things, <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Singling</hi> out of <hi>Parts,</hi> is the life of <hi>Diſpatch;</hi> So as the <hi>Diſtribution</hi> be not
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:176830:79"/>too ſubtill: For he that doth not diuide, will neuer enter well into Buſineſſe; And he that diuideth too much, will neuer come out of it clearely. To chooſe Time, is to ſaue Time; And an Vnſeaſonable Motion is but Beating the Ayre. There be three Parts of Buſineſſe: The <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> The <hi>Debate,</hi> or <hi>Examination;</hi> And the <hi>Perfection.</hi> Whereof, if you looke for <hi>Diſpatch,</hi> let the Middle onely be the Worke of Many, and the Firſt and Laſt the Worke of Few. The Proceeding vpon ſomewhat conceiued in Writing, doth for the moſt part facilitate <hi>Diſpatch:</hi> For though it ſhould be wholly reiected, yet that <hi>Negatiue</hi> is more pregnant of Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then an <hi>Indefinite;</hi> As Aſhes are more Generatiue then Duſt.</p>

But little doe Men perceiue, what <hi>Solitude</hi> is, and how farre it extendeth. For a Crowd is not Company; and Faces are but a Gallery of Pictures; And Talke but a <hi>Tinckling Cymball,</hi> where there is no <hi>Loue.</hi> The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Adage meeteth with it a little; <hi>Magna Ciuitas, Magna ſolitudo;</hi> Becauſe in a great Towne, <hi>Friends</hi> are ſcattered; So that there is not that Fellowſhip, for the moſt Part, which is in leſſe <hi>Neighbourhoods.</hi> But we may goe further, and affirme moſt truly; That it is a meere, and miſerable <hi>Solitude,</hi> to want true <hi>Friends,</hi> without which the World is but a Wilderneſſe: And euen in this ſenſe alſo of <hi>Solitude,</hi> whoſoeuer in the Frame of his Nature and Affections, is vnſit for <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> he taketh it of the Beaſt, and not from Humanity.</p>
            <p>A principall <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> is the Eaſe and Diſcharge of the Fulneſſe and Swellings of the Heart, which Paſſions
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:176830:82"/>of all kinds doe cauſe and induce. We know Diſeaſes of Stoppings, and Suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, are the moſt dangerous in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; And it is not much otherwiſe in the Minde: You may take <hi>Sarza</hi> to open the Liuer; <hi>Steele</hi> to open the Spleene, <hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>Sulphur</hi> for the Lungs; <hi>Caſtoreum</hi> for the Braine; But no Receipt openeth the Heart, but a true Friend, to whom you may impart, Griefes, Ioyes, Feares, Hopes, Suſpicions, Counſels, and whatſoeuer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon the Heart, to oppreſſe it, in a kind of Ciuill Shrift or Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>It is a Strange Thing to obſerue, how high a Rate, Great Kings and Monarchs, do ſet vpon this <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſpeake: So great, as they purchaſe it, many times, at the hazard of their owne Safety, and Greatneſſe.

The Moderne Languages giue vnto ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Name of <hi>Fauorites,</hi> or <hi>Priuadoes;</hi> As if it were Matter of Grace, or Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.

               <hi>L.

For when he had carried the <hi>Conſulſhip</hi> for a Frend of his, againſt the purſuit of <hi>Sylla,</hi> and that <hi>Sylla</hi> did a little reſent thereat, and began to ſpeake great, <hi>Pompey</hi> turned vpon him
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:176830:83"/>againe, and in effect bad him be quiet; <hi>For that more Men adored the Sunne Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, then the Sunne ſetting.</hi> With <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, Decimus Brutus</hi> had obtained that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as he ſet him downe, in his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for Heire in Remainder, after his <hi>Nephew.</hi> And this was the Man, that had power with him, to draw him forth to his death. For when <hi>Caeſar</hi> would haue diſcharged the Senate, in regard of ſome ill Preſages, and ſpecially a Dreame of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purnia;</hi> This Man lifted him gently by the Arme, out of his Chaire, telling him, he hoped he would not diſmiſſe the Senate, till his wife had dreamt a better Dreame. And it ſeemeth, his fauour was ſo great, as <hi>Antonius</hi> in a Letter, which is recited <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim,</hi> in one of <hi>Cicero's Philippiques,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him <hi>Venefica, Witch;</hi> As if he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted <hi>Caeſar.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:176830:84"/>Agrippa, or take away his life, there was no third way, he had made him ſo great.</hi> With <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius Caeſar, Scianus</hi> had aſcended to that Height, as they Two were tearmed and reckoned, as a Paire of Frends. <hi>Tiberius</hi> in a Letter to him ſaith; <hi>Hec pro Amici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia nostrâ non occultaui:</hi> And the whole Senate, dedicated an Altar to <hi>Frendſhip,</hi> as to a <hi>Goddeſſe,</hi> in reſpect of the great Deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Frendſhip,</hi> between them Two. The like or more was between <hi>Septimius Seuerus,</hi> and <hi>Plantianus.</hi> For he forced his Eldeſt Sonne to marry the Daughter of <hi>Plantianus;</hi> And would often maintaine <hi>Plantianus,</hi> in doing Affronts to his Son: And did write alſo in a Letter to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, by theſe Words; <hi>I loue the Man ſo well, as I wiſh he may ouer-liue me.</hi> Now if theſe Princes, had beene as a <hi>Traian,</hi> or a <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> A Man might haue thought, that this had proceeded of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Goodneſſe of Nature; But being Men ſo Wiſe, of ſuch Strength and Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of minde, and ſo Extreme Louers of Themſelues, as all theſe were; It proueth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:176830:84"/>moſt plainly, that they found their owne Felicitie (though as great as euer happened to Mortall Men) but as an Halfe Peece, except they mought haue a <hi>Frend</hi> to make it Entire: And yet, which is more, they were <hi>Princes,</hi> that had Wiues, Sonnes, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews; And yet all theſe could not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Comfort of <hi>Frendſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not to be forgotten, what <hi>Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> obſerueth, of his firſt Maſter <hi>Duke Charles</hi> the <hi>Hardy;</hi> Namely, that hee would communicate his Secrets with none; And leaſt of all, thoſe Secrets, which troubled him moſt. Whereupon he goeth on, and ſaith, That towards his Latter time; <hi>That cloſeneſſe did impaire, and a little periſh his vnderstanding.</hi> Surely <hi>Commineus</hi> mought haue made the ſame Iudgement alſo, if it had pleaſed him, of his Second Maſter <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleuenth, whoſe cloſeneſſe was indeed his Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. The Parable of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> is darke, but true; <hi>Cor ne edito; Eat not the Heart.</hi> Certainly, if a Man would giue it a hard Phraſe, Thoſe that want <hi>Frends</hi> to open
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:176830:85"/>themſelues vnto, are Canniballs of their owne <hi>Hearts.</hi> But one Thing is moſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, (wherewith I will conclude this firſt <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>frendſhip</hi>) which is, that this Communicating of a Mans Selfe to his <hi>Frend,</hi> works two contrarie Effects; For it redoubleth <hi>Ioyes,</hi> and cutteth <hi>Griefes</hi> in Halfes. For there is no Man, that impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his <hi>Ioyes</hi> to his <hi>Frend,</hi> but he <hi>ioyeth</hi> the more; And no Man, that imparteth his <hi>Griefes</hi> to his <hi>Frend,</hi> but hee <hi>grieueth</hi> the leſſe. So that it is, in Truth of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon a Mans Minde, of like vertue, as the <hi>Alchymists</hi> vſe to attribute to their Stone, for Mans Bodie; That it worketh all Contrary Effects, but ſtill to the Good, and Benefit of Nature. But yet, without praying in Aid of <hi>Alchymists,</hi> there is a manifeſt Image of this, in the ordinarie courſe of Nature. For in Bodies, <hi>Vnion</hi> ſtrengthneth and cheriſheth any Naturall Action; And, on the other ſide, weakneth and dulleth any violent Impreſſion: And euen ſo is it of Minds.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Fruit of Frendſhip,</hi> is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:176830:85"/>Healthfull and Soueraigne for the <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> as the firſt is for the <hi>Affections.</hi> For <hi>Frendſhip</hi> maketh indeed a <hi>faire Day</hi> in the <hi>Affections,</hi> from Storme and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts: But it maketh <hi>Day-light</hi> in the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> out of Darkneſſe &amp; Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Thoughts. Neither is this to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, onely of Faithfull Counſell, which a Man receiueth from his <hi>Frend;</hi> But before you come to that, certaine it is, that whoſoeuer hath his Minde fraught, with many Thoughts, his Wits and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding doe clarifie and breake vp, in the Communicating and diſcourſing with Another: He toſſeth his Thoughts, more eaſily; He marſhalleth them more orderly; He ſeeth how they looke when they are turned into Words; Finally, He waxeth wiſer then Himſelfe; And that more by an Houres diſcourſe, then by a Dayes Meditation. It was well ſaid by <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> to the King of <hi>Perſia; That ſpeech was like Cloth of Arras, opened, and put abroad; Whereby the Imagery doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in Figure; whereas in Thoughts, they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:176830:86"/>lie but as in Packs.</hi> Neither is this Second <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Frendſhip,</hi> in opening the <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> reſtrained onely to ſuch <hi>Frends,</hi> as are able to giue a Man Counſell: (They indeed are beſt) But euen, without that, a Man learneth of Himſelfe, and bringeth his owne Thoughts to Light, and whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his Wits as againſt a Stone, which it ſelfe cuts not. In a word, a Man were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter relate himſelfe, to a Statua, or Picture, then to ſuffer his Thoughts to paſſe in ſmother.</p>
            <p>Adde now, to make this Second <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Frendſhip</hi> compleat, that other Point, which lieth more open, and falleth within Vulgar Obſeruation; which is <hi>Faithfull Counſell</hi> from a <hi>Frend. Heraclitus</hi> ſaith well, in one of his Aenigmaes; <hi>Dry Light is euer the beſt.</hi> And certaine it is, that the Light, that a Man receiueth, by Counſell from Another, is Drier, and purer, then that which commeth from his owne Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and Iudgement; which is euer infuſed and drenched in his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cuſtomes. So as, there is as much
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:176830:86"/>difference, betweene the <hi>Counſell,</hi> that a <hi>Frend</hi> giueth, and that a Man giueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as there is between the <hi>Counſell</hi> of a <hi>Frend,</hi> and of a <hi>Flatterer.</hi> For there is no ſuch <hi>Flatterer,</hi> as is a Mans Selfe; And there is no ſuch Remedy, againſt <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of a Mans Selfe, as the Liberty of a <hi>Frend. Counſell</hi> is of two Sorts; The one concerning <hi>Manners,</hi> the other concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Buſineſſe.</hi> For the Firſt; The beſt Preſeruatiue to keep the Minde in Health, is the faithfull Admonition of a <hi>Frend.</hi> The Calling of a Mans Selfe, to a Strict Account, is a Medicine, ſometime, too Piercing and Corroſiue. Reading good Bookes of <hi>Morality,</hi> is a little Flat, and Dead. Obſeruing our Faults in Others, is ſometimes vnproper for our Caſe. But the beſt Receipt (beſt (I ſay) to worke, and beſt to take) is the Admonition of a <hi>Frend.</hi> It is a ſtrange thing to behold, what groſſe Errours, and extreme Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, Many (eſpecially of the greater Sort) doe commit, for want of a <hi>Frend,</hi> to tell them of them; To the great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:176830:87"/>both of their Fame, &amp; Fortune. For, as <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſaith, they are as Men, <hi>that looke ſometimes into a Glaſſe, and preſently forget their own Shape, &amp; Fauour.</hi> As for <hi>Buſineſſe,</hi> a Man may think, if he will, that two Eyes ſee no more then one; Or that a Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſeeth alwaies more then a Looker on; Or that a Man in Anger, is as Wiſe as he, that hath ſaid ouer the foure and twenty Letters; Or that a Musket may be ſhot off, aſwell vpon the Arme, as vpon a Reſt; And ſuch other fond and high Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to thinke Himſelfe All in All. But when all is done, the Helpe of good <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,</hi> is that, which ſetteth <hi>Buſineſſe</hi> ſtraight. And if any Man thinke, that he will take <hi>Counſell,</hi> but it ſhall be by Peeces; Asking <hi>Counſell</hi> in one Buſineſſe of one Man, and in another Buſineſſe of another Man; It is well, (that is to ſay, better perhaps then if he asked none at all;) but he runneth two dangers: One, that he ſhall not be faithfully counſelled; For it is a rare Thing, except it be from a perfect and entire <hi>Frend,</hi> to haue Counſell giuen, but ſuch
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:176830:87"/>as ſhalbe bowed and crooked to ſome ends, which he hath that giueth it. The other, that he ſhall haue Counſell giuen, hurtfull, and vnſafe, (though with good Meaning) and mixt, partly of Miſchiefe, and partly of Remedy: Euen as if you would call a Phyſician, that is thought good, for the Cure of the Diſeaſe, you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of, but is vnacquainted with your body; And therefore, may put you in way for a preſent Cure, but ouerthroweth your Health in ſome other kinde; And ſo cure the Diſeaſe, and kill the Patient. But a <hi>Frend,</hi> that is wholly acquainted with a Mans Eſtate, will beware by furthering any preſent <hi>Buſineſſe,</hi> how he daſheth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Inconuenience. And therefore, reſt not vpon <hi>Scattered Counſels;</hi> They will rather diſtract, and Miſleade, then Settle, and Direct.</p>
            <p>After theſe two Noble <hi>Fruits of Frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; (Peace in the Affections,</hi> and <hi>Support of the Iudgement,)</hi> followeth the laſt <hi>Fruit;</hi> which is like the <hi>Pomgranat,</hi> full of many kernels; I meane <hi>Aid,</hi> and <hi>Bearing a Part,</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:176830:88"/>in all <hi>Actions,</hi> and <hi>Occaſions.</hi> Here, the beſt Way, to repreſent to life the manifold vſe of <hi>Frendſhip,</hi> is to caſt and ſee, how many Things there are, which a Man cannot doe Himſelfe; And then it will appeare, that it was a Sparing Speech of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, to ſay, <hi>That a Frend is another Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:</hi> For that a <hi>Frend</hi> is farre more then <hi>Himſelfe.</hi> Men haue their Time, and die many times in deſire of ſome Things, which they principally take to Heart; The Beſtowing of a Child, The Finiſhing of a Worke, Or the like. If a Man haue a true <hi>Frend,</hi> be may reſt almoſt ſecure, that the Care of thoſe Things, will continue after Him. So that a Man hath as it were two Liues in his deſires. A Man hath a Body, and that Body is confined to a Place; But where <hi>Frendſhip</hi> is, all Offices of Life, are as it were granted to Him, and his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

A Man had need, if he be Plentifull, in ſome kinde of <hi>Expence,</hi> to be as Sauing againe, in ſome other.

Certainly, who hath a State to repaire, may not deſpiſe ſmall Things: And commonly, it is leſſe diſhonourable, to abridge pettie Charges, then to ſtoope to pettie Gettings.

               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:176830:94"/>receiued into Cuſtome, doth much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, vnto <hi>Martiall Greatneſſe.</hi> Whereas, contrariwiſe, the Cloſe and Reſerued li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, of <hi>Noblemen,</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> cauſeth a Penury of <hi>Military Forces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all meanes, it is to be procured, that the <hi>Trunck</hi> of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Tree of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> be great enough, to beare the Branches, and the Boughes; That is, That the <hi>Naturall Subiects</hi> of the Crowne or State, beare a ſufficient Proportion, to the <hi>Stranger Subiects,</hi> that they gouerne. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all States, that are liberall of Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization towards Strangers, are fit for <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> For to thinke, that an Handfull of People, can, with the greateſt Courage, and Policy in the World, embrace too large Extent of Dominion, it may hold for a time, but it will faile ſuddainly. The <hi>Spartans</hi> were a nice People, in Point of Naturalization; whereby, while they kept their Compaſſe, they ſtood firme; But when they did ſpread, and their Boughs were becommen too great, for their Stem, they became a Windfall vpon the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:176830:95"/>ſuddaine. Neuer any State was, in this Point, ſo open to receiue <hi>Strangers,</hi> into their Body, as were the <hi>Romans.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſorted with them accordingly; For they grew to the greateſt <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Their manner was, to grant Naturalization, (which they called <hi>Ius Ciuitatis</hi>) and to grant it in the higheſt Degree; That is, Not onely <hi>Ius Commercij, Ius Connubij, Ius Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatis;</hi> But alſo, <hi>Ius Suffragij,</hi> and <hi>Ius Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum.</hi> And this, not to Singular Perſons alone, but likewiſe to whole Families; yea to Cities, and ſometimes to Nations. Adde to this, their Cuſtome of <hi>Plantation</hi> of <hi>Colonies;</hi> whereby the Roman Plant, was remoued into the Soile, of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And putting both Conſtitutions together, you will ſay, that it was not the <hi>Romans</hi> that ſpred vpon the <hi>World;</hi> But it was the <hi>World,</hi> that ſpred vpon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> And that was the ſure Way of <hi>Greatneſſe.</hi> I haue marueiled ſometimes at <hi>Spaine,</hi> how they claſpe and containe ſo large Dominions, with ſo few Naturall <hi>Spaniards:</hi> But ſure, the whole Compaſſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:176830:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>of <hi>Spaine,</hi> is a very Great Body of a Tree; Farre aboue <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Sparta,</hi> at the firſt. And beſides, though they haue not had that vſage, to Naturalize liberally; yet they haue that, which is next to it; That is, <hi>To employ, almoſt indifferently, all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in their Militia of ordinary Soldiers:</hi> yea, and ſometimes in their <hi>Higheſt Commands.</hi> Nay, it ſeemeth at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, they are ſenſible of this want of Natiues; as by the <hi>Pragmaticall Sanction,</hi> now publiſhed, appeareth.</p>
            <p>It is certaine, that <hi>Sedentary,</hi> and <hi>Within-doore Arts,</hi> and delicate Manufactures (that require rather the Finger, then the Arme) haue, in their Nature, a Contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to a Military diſpoſition. And gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, all Warlike People, are a little idle; And loue Danger better then Trauaile: Neither muſt they be too much broken of it, if they ſhall be preſerued in vigour. Therefore, it was great Aduantage, in the Ancient States of <hi>Sparta, Athens, Rome,</hi> and others, that they had the vſe of <hi>Slaues,</hi> which commonly did rid thoſe Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:176830:96"/>But that is aboliſhed, in greateſt part, by the <hi>Chriſtian Law.</hi> That which commeth neareſt to it, is, to leaue thoſe Arts chiefly to Strangers, (which for that purpoſe are the more eaſily to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) and to containe, the principall Bulke of the vulgar Natiues, within thoſe three kinds; <hi>Tillers</hi> of the Ground; <hi>Free Seruants;</hi> &amp; <hi>Handy-Crafts-Men,</hi> of Strong, &amp; Manly Arts, as Smiths, Maſons, Carpenters,  Not reckoning Profeſſed Souldiers.</p>
            <p>But aboue all, for <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> it importeth moſt; That a Nation doe profeſſe Armes, as their principall Honour, Study, and Occupation. For the Things, which we formerly haue ſpoken of, are but <hi>Habilitations</hi> towards Armes: And what is <hi>Habilitation</hi> without <hi>Intention</hi> and <hi>Act? Romulus,</hi> after his death (as they report, or faigne) ſent a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the <hi>Romans;</hi> That, aboue all, they ſhould intend Armes; And then, they ſhould proue the greateſt <hi>Empire</hi> of the World. The Fabrick of the State of <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> was wholly (though not wiſely) fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:176830:96"/>and compoſed, to that Scope and End. The <hi>Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> had it for a flaſh. The <hi>Galls, Germans, Goths, Saxons, Normans,</hi> and others, had it for a Time. The <hi>Turks</hi> haue it, at this day, though in great Declination. Of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Europe,</hi> they that haue it, are, in effect, onely the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But it is ſo plaine, <hi>That euery Man profiteth in that hee moſt intendeth,</hi> that it needeth not to be ſtood vpon. It is enough to point at it; That no Nation, which doth not directly profeſſe Armes, may looke to haue <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> fall into their Mouths. And, on the other ſide, it is a moſt Certaine Oracle of Time; That thoſe States, that continue long in that Profeſſion (as the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> principally haue done) do wonders. And thoſe, that haue profeſſed Armes but for an Age, haue notwithſtanding, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, attained that <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> in that Age, which maintained them long after, when their Profeſſion and Exerciſe of Armes hath growen to decay.</p>
            <p>Incident to this Point is; For a State, to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:176830:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>haue thoſe Lawes or Cuſtomes, which may reach forth vnto them, iuſt Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as may be pretended) of Warre. For there is that Iuſtice imprinted, in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Men, that they enter not vpon Wars (whereof ſo many Calamities doe enſue) but vpon ſome, at the leaſt Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Grounds and Quarells. The <hi>Turke,</hi> hath at hand, for Cauſe of Warre, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of his Law or Sect; A Quarell that he may alwaies Command. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> though they eſteemed, the Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Limits of their Empire, to be great Honour to their Generalls, when it was done, yet they neuer reſted vpon that alone, to begin a Warre. Firſt therefore, let Nations, that pretend to <hi>Greatneſſe,</hi> haue this; That they be ſenſible of Wrongs, either vpon Borderers, Merchants, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique Miniſters; And that they ſit not too long vpon a Prouocation. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let them be preſt, and ready, to giue Aids and Succours, to their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates: As it euer was with the <hi>Romans:</hi> In ſo much, as if the Confederate, had
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:176830:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>Leagues Defenſiue with diuers other States, and vpon Inuaſion offered, did implore their Aides ſeuerally, yet the <hi>Romans</hi> would euer bee the formoſt, and leaue it to none Other to haue the Honour. As for the Warres, which were anciently made, on the behalfe, of a kinde of Partie, or tacite Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Eſtate, I doe not ſee how they may be well iuſtified: As when the <hi>Romans</hi> made a Warre for the Libertie of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia:</hi> Or when the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and <hi>Athenians,</hi> made Warres, to ſet vp or pull downe <hi>Democracies,</hi> and <hi>Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies:</hi> Or when Warres were made by Forrainers, vnder the pretence of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or Protection, to deliuer the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of others, from Tyrannie, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; And the like. Let it ſuffice, That no Eſtate expect to be <hi>Great,</hi> that is not awake, vpon any iuſt Occaſion of Arming.</p>

To be free minded, and cheerefully diſpoſed, at Houres of Meat, and of Sleep, and of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, is one of the beſt Precepts of Long laſting.

<q>Parce Puer ſtimulis, &amp; fortiùs vtere Loris.</q> And generally, Men ought to finde the difference, between Saltneſſe and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:176830:105"/>For he ſhall giue them occaſion, to pleaſe themſelues in Speaking, and himſelfe ſhall continually gather Knowledge. But let his Queſtions, not be troubleſome; For that is fit for a Poſer. And let him be ſure, to leaue other Men their Turnes to ſpeak. Nay, if there be any, that would raigne, and take vp all the time, let him finde meanes to take them off, and to bring O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on; As Muſicians vſe to doe, with thoſe, that dance too long Galliards. If you diſſemble ſometimes your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of that you are thought to know; you ſhall be thought another time, to know that, you know not.

And of Rice likewiſe commeth a great Encreaſe, and it is a kinde of Meat. Aboue all, there ought to be brought Store of Bisket, Oat-meale, Flower, Meale, and the like, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, till Bread may be had. For Beaſts, or Birds, take chiefly ſuch, as are leaſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to Diſeaſes, and Multiply faſteſt: As Swine, Goats, Cockes, Hennes, Turkies, Geeſe, Houſe-doues, and the like.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot call <hi>Riches</hi> better, then the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage of Vertue. The <hi>Roman</hi> Word is better, <hi>Impedimenta.</hi> For as the Baggage is to an Army, ſo is <hi>Riches</hi> to Vertue. It cannot be ſpared, nor left behinde, but it hindreth the March; Yea, and the care of it, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, loſeth or diſturbeth the Victory: Of great <hi>Riches,</hi> there is no Reall Vſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in the Diſtribution; The reſt is but Conceit. So ſaith <hi>Salomon; Where much is, there are Many to conſume it; And what hath the Owner, but the Sight of it, with his Eyes?</hi> The Perſonall Fruition in any Man, cannot reach to feele Great <hi>Riches:</hi> There is a Cuſtody of them; Or a Power of Dole and Donatiue of them; Or a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:176830:110"/>Fame of them; But no Solid Vſe to the Owner. Doe you not ſee, what fained Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are ſet vpon little Stones, and Rarities? And what Works of Oſtentation, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, becauſe there might ſeeme to be, ſome Vſe of great <hi>Riches?</hi> But then you will ſay, they may be of vſe, to buy Men out of Dangers or Troubles. As <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith; <hi>Riches are as a ſtrong Hold, in the Imagination of the Rich Man.</hi> But this is excellently expreſſed, that it is in <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and not alwaies in <hi>Fact.</hi> For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Great <hi>Riches,</hi> haue ſold more Men, then they haue bought out.

Meaning, that <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> gotten by Good Meanes, and Iuſt Labour, pace ſlowly; But when they come by the death of Others, (As by the Courſe of Inheritance, Teſtaments, and the like,) they come tumbling vpon a Man. But it mought be applied likewiſe to <hi>Pluto,</hi> taking him for the Deuill. For when <hi>Riches</hi> come from the Deuill, (as by Fraud, and Oppreſſion, and vniuſt Meanes,) they come vpon Speed. The <hi>Waies to enrich</hi> are many, and moſt of them Foule. <hi>Parſimony</hi> is one of the beſt, and yet is not Innocent: For it with-holdeth Men, from Workes of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, and Charity. The <hi>Improuement of the Ground,</hi> is the moſt Naturall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of <hi>Riches;</hi> For it is our Great Mothers Bleſſing, the Earths; But it is ſlow. And yet, where Men of great wealth, doe ſtoope to husbandry, it mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplieth <hi>Riches</hi> exceedingly. I knew a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:176830:111"/>Nobleman in <hi>England,</hi> that had the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Audits, of any Man in my Time: A Great Graſier, A Great Sheepe-Maſter, A Great Timber Man, A Great Colliar, A Great Corne-Maſter, A Great Lead-Man, and ſo of Iron, and a Number of the like Points of Husbandry. So as the Earth ſeemed a Sea to him, in reſpect of the Perpetuall Importation. It was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerued by One, that Himſelfe came very hardly to a Little <hi>Riches,</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſily to Great <hi>Riches.</hi> For when a Mans Stocke is come to that, that he can expect the Prime of Markets, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome thoſe Bargaines, which for their greatneſſe are few Mens Money, and be Partner in the Induſtries of Younger Men, he cannot but encreaſe mainely. The <hi>Gaines</hi> of <hi>Ordinary Trades</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> are honeſt; And furthered by two Things, chiefly: By Diligence; And By a good Name, for good and faire dealing. But the <hi>Gaines</hi> of <hi>Bargaines,</hi> are of a more doubtfull Nature; When Men ſhall waite vpon Others Neceſſity,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:176830:111"/>broake by Seruants and Inſtruments to draw them on, Put off Others cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that would be better Chapmen, and the like Practiſes, which are Crafty and Naught. As for the <hi>Chopping of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines,</hi> when a Man Buies, not to Hold, but to Sell ouer againe, that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Grindeth double, both vpon the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and vpon the Buyer. <hi>Sharings,</hi> doe greatly <hi>Enrich,</hi> if the Hands be well cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, that are truſted. <hi>Vſury</hi> is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt Meanes of Gaine, though one of the worſt; As that, whereby a Man doth eate his Bread; <hi>In ſudore vultûs alieni:</hi> And beſides, doth Plough vpon Sundaies. But yet Certaine though it be, it hath Flawes; For that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueners and Broakers, doe valew vnſound Men, to ſerue their owne Turne. The <hi>Fortune,</hi> in being the Firſt in an <hi>Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or in a <hi>Priuiledge,</hi> doth cauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a wonderfull Ouergrowth in <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> As it was with the firſt Sugar Man, in the <hi>Canaries:</hi> Therefore, if a Man can play the true <hi>Logician,</hi> to haue as well
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:176830:112"/>Iudgement, as Inuention, he may do great Matters; eſpecially if the Times be fit. He that reſteth vpon <hi>Gaines Certaine,</hi> ſhall hardly grow to great <hi>Riches:</hi> And he that puts all vpon <hi>Aduentures,</hi> doth often times breake, and come to Pouerty: It is good therefore, to guard <hi>Aduentures</hi> with <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,</hi> that may vphold loſſes. <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> and <hi>Coemption</hi> of <hi>Wares</hi> for <hi>Reſale,</hi> where they are not reſtrained, are great Meanes to enrich; eſpecially, if the Partie haue intelligence, what Things are like to come into Requeſt, and ſo ſtore Himſelfe before hand. <hi>Riches</hi> gotten by <hi>Seruice,</hi> though it be of the beſt Riſe, yet when they are gotten by Flattery, Feeding Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and other Seruile Conditions, they may be placed amongſt the Worſt. As for Fiſhing for <hi>Teſtaments</hi> and <hi>Executorſhips</hi> (as <hi>Tacit</hi> ſaith of <hi>Seneca; Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta et Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos, ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quàm Indagine capi;</hi>) It is yet worſe; By how much Men ſubmit themſelues, to Meaner Perſons, then in <hi>Seruice.</hi> Beleeue not much them, that ſeeme to deſpiſe <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> For they deſpiſe them, that deſpaire
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:176830:112"/>of them; And none Worſe, when they come to them. Be not Penny-wiſe; <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> haue Wings, and ſometimes they Fly away of themſelues, ſometimes they muſt be ſet Flying to bring in more. Men leaue their <hi>Riches,</hi> either to their Kindred; Or to the Publique: And moderate Portions proſper beſt in both. A great State left to an Heire, is as a Lure to all the Birds of Prey, round about, to ſeize on him, if he be not the better ſtabliſhed in Yeares and Iudgement. Likewiſe Glorious Gifts and Foundations, are like <hi>Sacrifices without Salt;</hi> And but the <hi>Painted Sepulchres of Almes,</hi> which ſoone will putrifie, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt inwardly. Therefore, Meaſure not thine Aduancements by Quantity, but Frame them by Meaſure; And Deferre not Charities till Death: For certainly, if a Man weigh it rightly, he that doth ſo, is rather Liberall of an Other Mans, then of his Owne.</p>

The Laſt, that it is the Canker and Ruine of many Mens Eſtates; Which in proceſſe of Time breeds a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Pouertie.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Commodities</hi> of <hi>Vſury</hi> are. Firſt, that howſoeuer <hi>Vſury</hi> in
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:176830:128"/>ſome reſpect hindereth Merchandizing, yet in ſome other it aduanceth it: For it is certain, that the Greateſt Part of Trade, is driuen by Young Merchants, vpon Borrowing at Intereſt: So as if the <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> either call in, or keepe backe his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, there will enſue preſently a great Stand of Trade. The Second is, That were it not, for this eaſie borrowing vpon <hi>Intereſt,</hi> Mens neceſſities would draw vpon them, a moſt ſudden vndoing; In that they would be forced to ſell their Meanes (be it Lands or Goods) farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Foot; and ſo, whereas <hi>Vſury</hi> doth but Gnaw vpon them, Bad Markets would Swallow them quite vp. As for Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, or Pawning, it will little mend the matter; For either Men will not take Pawnes without <hi>Vſe;</hi> Or if they doe, they will looke preciſely for the Forfeiture. I remember a Cruell Moneyed Man, in the Country, that would ſay; The Deuill take this <hi>Vſury,</hi> it keepes vs from Forfeitures, of Mortgages, and Bonds. The third and Laſt is, That it is a Vanitie to conceiue,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:176830:128"/>that there would be Ordinary Borrowing without Profit; And it is impoſſible to conceiue, the Number of Inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that will enſue, if Borrowing be Cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Therefore, to ſpeake of the Aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Vſury</hi> is Idle. All States haue euer had it, in one Kinde or Rate, or other. So as that Opinion muſt be ſent to <hi>Vtopia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſpeake now, of the <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Reiglement</hi> of <hi>Vſury;</hi> How the <hi>Diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities</hi> of it may be beſt auoided, and the <hi>Commodities</hi> retained. It appeares by the Ballance, of <hi>Commodities,</hi> and <hi>Diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities</hi> of <hi>Vſury,</hi> Two Things are to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. The one, that the <hi>Tooth</hi> of <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> begrinded, that it bite not too much: The other, that there bee left open a Meanes, to inuite Moneyed Men, to lend to the Merchants, for the Continuing and Quickning of Trade. This cannot be done, except you introduce, two ſeuerall <hi>Sorts</hi> of <hi>Vſury;</hi> A <hi>Leſſe,</hi> and a <hi>Greater.</hi> For if you reduce <hi>Vſury,</hi> to one Low Rate, it will eaſe the common Borrower, but the Merchant wil be to ſeeke for Money. And
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:176830:129"/>it is to be noted, that the Trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, being the moſt Lucratiue, may beare <hi>Vſury</hi> at a good Rate; Other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts not ſo.</p>
            <p>To ſerue both Intentions, the way would be briefly thus. That there be <hi>Two Rates</hi> of <hi>Vſury,</hi> The one Free, and Generall for All; The other vnder <hi>Licence</hi> only, to <hi>Certaine Perſons,</hi> and in <hi>Certaine Places</hi> of <hi>Merchandizing.</hi> Firſt therefore, let <hi>Vſury, in generall, be reduced to Fiue in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;</hi> And let that Rate be proclaimed to be Free and Current; And let the State ſhut it ſelfe out, to take any Penalty for the ſame. This will preſerue Borrowing from any generall Stop or Drineſſe. This will eaſe infinite Borrowers in the Countrie. This will, in good Part, raiſe the Price of Land, becauſe Land purchaſed at Sixteene yeares Purchaſe, wil yeeld Six in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and ſomewhat more, whereas this Rate of Intereſt, Yeelds but Fiue. This, by like reaſon, will Encourage and edge, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and Profitable Improuements; Becauſe Many will rather venture in that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:176830:129"/>kinde, then take Fiue in the Hundred, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hauing beene vſed to greater Profit. Secondly, let there be <hi>Certaine Perſons li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to Lend, to knowne Merchants,</hi> vpon <hi>Vſury</hi> at a <hi>Higher-Rate;</hi> and let it be with the Cautions following. Let the Rate be, euen with the Merchant himſelfe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more eaſie, then that he vſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to pay: For, by that Meanes, all Borrowers ſhall haue ſome eaſe, by this Reformation, be he Merchant, or whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer. Let it be no Banke or Common Stocke, but euery Man be Maſter of his owne Money: Not that I altogether Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Banks, but they will hardly be broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, in regard of certain ſuſpicions. Let the State be anſwered, ſome ſmall Matter, for the Licence, and the reſt left to the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: For if the Abatement be but ſmall, it will no whit diſcourage the Lender. For he, for Example, that tooke before Ten or Nine in the Hundred, wil ſooner deſcend to Eight in the Hundred, then giue ouer his Trade of <hi>Vſury;</hi> And goe from Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Gaines, to Gaines of Hazard. Let
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:176830:130"/>theſe Licenced Lenders be in Number In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, but reſtrained to Certaine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Cities and Townes of Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing: For then they will be hardly able, to Colour other Mens Moneyes, in the Country: So as the <hi>Licence of Nine,</hi> will not ſucke away the current <hi>Rate of Fiue:</hi> For no Man will ſend his Moneyes farre off, nor put them into Vnknown Hands.</p>
            <p>If it be Obiected, that this doth, in a Sort, Authorize <hi>Vſury,</hi> which before was, in ſome places, but Permiſſiue: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is; That it is better, to Mitigate <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> by <hi>Declaration,</hi> then to ſuffer it to Rage by <hi>Conniuence.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ertue is like a Rich Stone, beſt plaine ſet: And ſurely Vertue is beſt in a Body, that is comely, though not of Delicate Features: And that hath rather dignity of Preſence, then <hi>Beauty</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Neither is it almoſt ſeene, that very <hi>Beautifull Perſons,</hi> are otherwiſe of great Vertue; As if Nature, were rather Buſie not to erre, then in labour, to produce Excellency. And therefore, they proue Accompliſhed, but not of great Spirit; And Study rather Behauiour, then Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; But this holds not alwaies; For <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar, Titus Veſpaſianus, Philip le Belle</hi> of <hi>France, Edward</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Alcibiades</hi> of <hi>Athens, Iſmael</hi> the <hi>Sophy</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> were all High and Great Spirits, And yet the moſt <hi>Beautifull Men</hi> of their
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:176830:133"/>Times. In <hi>Beauty,</hi> that of Fauour, is more then that of Colour, And that of Decent and Gracious Motion, more then that of Fauour.

There is no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Beauty,</hi> that hath not ſome Strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Proportion. A Man cannot tell, whether <hi>Apelles,</hi> or <hi>Albert Durer,</hi> were the more Trifler: Whereof the one would make a Perſonage by Geometricall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions: The other, by taking the beſt Parts out of diuers Faces, to make one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. Such Perſonages, I thinke, would pleaſe no Body, but the Painter, that made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

A Man ſhall ſee Faces, that if you examine them, Part by Part, you ſhall finde neuer a good; And yet all together doe well.

Certainly there is a Conſent between the Body and the Minde; And where Nature erreth in the One, ſhe ventureth in the Other. <hi>Vbi peccat in vno, periclita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in altero.</hi> But becauſe, there is in Man, an Election touching the Frame of his Minde, and a Neceſſity in the Frame of his Body, the Starres of Naturall Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are ſometimes obſcured, by the Sun of Diſcipline, and Vertue. Therefore, it is good to conſider of <hi>Deformity,</hi> not as a Signe, which is more Deceiuable; But as

As for the <hi>Tower,</hi> I would haue it two Stories, of Eighteene Foot High a peece, aboue the two Wings; And a Goodly <hi>Leads</hi> vpon the Top, railed with Statua's interpoſed; And the ſame <hi>Tower</hi> to bee diuided into Roomes, as ſhall be thought fit. The Staires likewiſe, to the vpper Roomes, let them bee vpon a Faire open <hi>Newell,</hi> and finely raild in, with <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Wood,</hi> caſt into a Braſſe Colour: And a very faire <hi>Landing Place</hi> at the Top. But this to be, if you doe not point, any of the lower Roomes, for a Dining Place of Seruants. For otherwiſe, you ſhall haue the Seruants Dinner, after your owne: For the Steame of it will come vp as in a Tunnell. And ſo much for the <hi>Front.</hi> Only, I vnderſtand the Height of the firſt Staires, to be Sixteene Foot; which is the Height of the Lower Roome.</p>
            <p>Beyond this <hi>Front,</hi> is there to be a Faire <hi>Court,</hi> but three Sides of it, of a Farre Lower building, then the <hi>Front.</hi> And in all the foure Corners of that Court, Faire Staire Caſes, caſt into <hi>Turrets,</hi> on the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:176830:138"/>and not within the Row of <hi>Buildings</hi> themſelues. But thoſe <hi>Towers,</hi> are not to be of the Height of the <hi>Front;</hi> But rather Proportionable to the Lower <hi>Building.</hi> Let the <hi>Court</hi> not be paued, for that ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp a great Heat in Summer, and much Cold in Winter. But onely ſome Side Alleys, with a Croſſe, and the <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> to Graze, being kept Shorne, but not too neare Shorne. The <hi>Row</hi> of <hi>Returne,</hi> on the <hi>Banquet Side,</hi> Let it be all <hi>Stately Galleries;</hi> In which <hi>Galleries,</hi> Let there be three, or fiue, fine <hi>Cupola's,</hi> in the Length of it, placed at equall diſtance: And fine <hi>Coloured Windowes</hi> of ſeuerall workes. On the Houſhold Side, <hi>Chambers</hi> of <hi>Preſence,</hi> and Ordinary Entertainments, with ſome <hi>Bed-chambers;</hi> And let all three Sides, be a double Houſe, without Thorow Lights, on the Sides, that you may haue Roomes from the Sunne, both for Fore-noone, and After-noone. Caſt it alſo, that you may haue Roomes, both for Summer, and Winter: Shadie for Summer, and Warme for Winter. You ſhall haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:176830:138"/>Faire <hi>Houſes,</hi> ſo full of Glaſſe, that one cannot tell, where to become, to be out of the Sunne, or Cold: For <hi>Inbowed Windowes,</hi> I hold them of good Vſe; (In Cities indeed, <hi>Vpright</hi> doe better, in reſpect of the Vniformitie towards the Street;) For they bee Prettie Retiring Places for Conference; And beſides, they keepe both the Wind, and Sunne off: For that which would ſtrike almoſt thorow the Roome, doth ſcarce paſſe the <hi>Window.</hi> But let them be but few, Foure in the <hi>Court,</hi> On the Sides onely.</p>
            <p>Beyond this <hi>Court,</hi> let there be an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court</hi> of the ſame Square, and Height; Which is to be enuironed, with the <hi>Garden,</hi> on all Sides: And in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, Cloiſtered on all Sides, vpon Decent and Beautifull Arches, as High as the firſt Story. On the <hi>Vnder Story,</hi> towards the <hi>Garden,</hi> Let it be turned to a <hi>Grotta,</hi> or Place of Shade, or Eſtiuation. And onely haue opening and <hi>Windowes</hi> towards the <hi>Garden;</hi> And be Leuell vpon the Floare, no whit ſunke vnder Ground, to auoid all
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:176830:139"/>Dampiſhneſſe. And let there be a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> or ſome faire <hi>Worke of Statua's,</hi> in the Middeſt of this <hi>Court;</hi> And to be Paued as the other Court was. Theſe Buildings to be for <hi>Priuie Lodgings,</hi> on both Sides; And the End, for <hi>Priuie Galleries.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, you muſt fore-ſee, that one of them, be for an <hi>Infirmary,</hi> if the Prince, or any Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Perſon ſhould be Sicke, with <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Bed-chamber, Anticamera,</hi> and <hi>Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi> ioyning to it. This vpon the Second Story. Vpon the <hi>Ground Story,</hi> a Faire <hi>Gallery, Open,</hi> vpon <hi>Pillars:</hi> And vpon the <hi>Third Story</hi> likewiſe, an <hi>Open Gallery</hi> vpon <hi>Pillars,</hi> to take the Proſpect, and Freſhneſſe of the <hi>Garden.</hi> At both Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the further Side, by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, Let there be two Delicate or Rich <hi>Cabinets,</hi> Daintily Paued, Richly Hanged, Glaſed with <hi>Crystalline Glaſſe,</hi> and a Rich <hi>Cupola</hi> in the Middeſt; And all other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie that may be thought vpon. In the <hi>Vpper Gallery</hi> too, I wiſh that there may be, if the Place will yeeld it, ſome <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> Running, in diuers Places, from the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:176830:139"/>Wall, with ſome fine Auoidances. And thus much, for the Modell of the <hi>Pallace:</hi> Saue that, you muſt haue, before you come to the <hi>Front,</hi> three Courts. A <hi>Greene Court Plain,</hi> with a Wall about it: A <hi>Second Court</hi> of the ſame, but more Garniſhed, with little Turrets, or rather Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vpon the Wall: And a <hi>Third Court,</hi> to make a Square with the <hi>Front,</hi> but not to be built, nor yet encloſed with a Naked Wall, but encloſed with <hi>Tarraſſes,</hi> Leaded aloft, and fairely garniſhed, on the three Sides; And Cloiſtered on the Inſide, with Pillars, and not with Arches Below. As for <hi>Offices,</hi> let them ſtand at Diſtance, with ſome <hi>Low Galleries,</hi> to paſſe from them, to the <hi>Pallace</hi> it Selfe.</p>

            <p>And becauſe, the <hi>Breath</hi> of Flowers, is farre Sweeter in the Aire, (where it comes and Goes, like the Warbling of Muſick) then in the hand, therfore nothing is more fit for that delight, then to know, what be the <hi>Flowers,</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> that doe beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume the Aire.

            <p>For <hi>Gardens,</hi> (Speaking of thoſe, which are indeed <hi>Prince-like,</hi> as we haue done of <hi>Buildings</hi>) the Contents, ought not well to be, vnder <hi>Thirty Acres of Ground;</hi> And to be diuided into three
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:176830:143"/>Parts: A <hi>Greene</hi> in the Entrance; A <hi>Heath</hi> or <hi>Deſart</hi> in the Going forth; And the <hi>Garden</hi> in the middeſt; Beſides <hi>Alleys,</hi> on both Sides. And I like well, that Foure Acres of Ground, be aſſigned to the <hi>Greene;</hi> Six to the <hi>Heath;</hi> Foure and Foure to either ſide; And Twelue to the <hi>Maine Garden.</hi> The Greene hath two pleaſures, The one, becauſe nothing is more Pleaſant to the Eye, then Greene Graſſe kept finely ſhorne; The other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will giue you a faire Alley in the midſt, by which you may go in front vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Stately Hedge,</hi> which is to incloſe the <hi>Garden.</hi> But, becauſe the Alley will be long, and in great Heat of the Yeare, or Day, you ought not to buy the ſhade, in the <hi>Garden,</hi> by Going in the Sunne thorow the <hi>Greene,</hi> therefore you are, of either <hi>Side</hi> the <hi>Greene,</hi> to Plant a <hi>Couert Alley,</hi> vpon Carpenters Worke, about Twelue Foot in Height, by which you may goe in Shade, into the <hi>Garden,</hi> As for the Making of <hi>Knots,</hi> or <hi>Figures,</hi> with <hi>Diuers Coloured Earths,</hi> that they may
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:176830:144"/>lie vnder the Windowes of the Houſe, on that Side, which the <hi>Garden</hi> ſtands, they be but Toyes: You may ſee as good Sights, many times, in Tarts. The <hi>Garden</hi> is beſt to be Square; Incompaſſed, on all the Foure Sides, with a <hi>Stately Arched Hedge.</hi> The <hi>Arches</hi> to be vpon <hi>Pillars,</hi> of Carpenters Worke, of ſome Ten Foot high, and Six Foot broad: And the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> between, of the ſame Dimenſion, with the <hi>Breadth</hi> of the <hi>Arch.</hi> Ouer the <hi>Arches,</hi> let there bee an <hi>Entire Hedge,</hi> of ſome Foure Foot High, framed alſo vpon Carpenters Worke: And vpon the <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Hedge,</hi> ouer euery <hi>Arch,</hi> a little <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> with a <hi>Belly,</hi> enough to receiue a <hi>Cage</hi> of <hi>Birds:</hi> And ouer euery <hi>Space,</hi> betweene the <hi>Arches,</hi> ſome other little <hi>Figure,</hi> with Broad Plates of <hi>Round Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Glaſſe,</hi> gilt, for the <hi>Sunne,</hi> to Play vpon. But this <hi>Hedge</hi> I entend to be, raiſed vpon a <hi>Bancke,</hi> not Steepe, but gently Slope, of ſome Six Foot, ſet all with <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> Alſo I vnderſtand, that this <hi>Square</hi> of the <hi>Garden,</hi> ſhould not be the whole
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:176830:144"/>Breadth of the Ground, but to leaue, on either Side, Ground enough, for diuerſity of <hi>Side Alleys:</hi> Vnto which, the Two <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert Alleys</hi> of the <hi>Greene,</hi> may deliuer you. But there muſt be, no <hi>Alleys</hi> with <hi>Hedges,</hi> at either <hi>End,</hi> of this great <hi>Incloſure:</hi> Not at the <hi>Hither End,</hi> for letting your Proſpect vpon this Faire Hedge from the <hi>Greene;</hi> Nor at the <hi>Further End,</hi> for letting your Proſpect from the Hedge, through the Arches, vpon the <hi>Heath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Ordering of the Ground, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Great Hedge,</hi> I leaue it to Variety of Deuice; Aduiſing neuertheleſſe, that whatſoeuer forme you caſt it into, firſt it be not too Buſie, or full of Worke. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I, for my part, doe not like <hi>Images Cut out</hi> in <hi>Iuniper,</hi> or other <hi>Garden ſtuffe:</hi> They be for Children. <hi>Little low Hedges,</hi> Round, like VVelts, with ſome Pretty <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramides,</hi> I like well: And in ſome Places, <hi>Faire Columnes</hi> vpon Frames of Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters VVorke. I would alſo, haue the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,</hi> Spacious and Faire. You may haue <hi>Cloſer Alleys</hi> vpon the <hi>Side Grounds,</hi> but
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:176830:145"/>none in the <hi>Maine Garden.</hi> I wiſh alſo, in the very Middle, a <hi>Faire Mount,</hi> with three Aſcents, and Alleys, enough for foure to walke a breaſt; Which I would haue to be Perfect Circles, without any Bulwarkes, or Imboſments; And the <hi>Whole Mount,</hi> to be Thirty Foot high; And ſome fine <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting Houſe,</hi> with ſome <hi>Chimneys</hi> neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt, and without too much <hi>Glaſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Fountaines,</hi> they are a great Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Refreſhment; But <hi>Pooles</hi> marre all, and make the <hi>Garden</hi> vnwholſome, and full of Flies, and Frogs. <hi>Fountaines</hi> I intend to be of two Natures: The One, that <hi>Sprinckleth</hi> or <hi>Spouteth Water;</hi> The Other a <hi>Faire Receipt</hi> of <hi>Water,</hi> of ſome Thirty or Forty Foot Square, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fiſh, or Slime, or Mud. For the firſt, the <hi>Ornaments</hi> of <hi>Images Gilt,</hi> or of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> which are in vſe, doe well: But the maine Matter is ſo to Conuey the Water, as it neuer Stay, either in the Bowles, or in the Ceſterne; That the Water be neuer by Reſt <hi>Diſcoloured, Greene,</hi> or <hi>Red,</hi> or the like; Or gather any <hi>Moſsineſſe</hi> or
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:176830:145"/>
               <hi>Putrefaction.</hi> Beſides that, it is to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed euery day by the Hand. Alſo ſome <hi>Steps</hi> vp to it, and ſome <hi>Fine Pauement</hi> about it, doth well. As for the other Kinde of <hi>Fountaine,</hi> which we may call a <hi>Bathing Poole,</hi> it may admit much Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; and Beauty; wherewith we will not trouble our ſelues: As, that the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome be finely Paued, And with Images: The ſides likewiſe; And withall Embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with Coloured Glaſſe, and ſuch Things of Luſtre; Encompaſſed alſo, with fine Railes of Low Statua's. But the Maine Point, is the ſame, which we mentioned, in the former Kinde of <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;</hi> which is, that the <hi>Water</hi> be in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Motion,</hi> Fed by a Water higher then the <hi>Poole.</hi> and Deliuered into it by faire Spouts, and then diſcharged away vnder Ground, by ſome Equalitie of Bores, that it ſtay little. And for fine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, of Arching Water without Spilling, and Making it riſe in ſeuerall Formes, (of Feathers, Drinking Glaſſes, Canopies, and the like,) they be pretty things to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:176830:146"/>looke on, but Nothing to Health and Sweetneſſe.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Heath,</hi> which was the Third Part of our Plot, I wiſh it to be framed, as much as may be, to a <hi>Naturall wildneſſe. Trees</hi> I would haue none in it; But ſome <hi>Thickets,</hi> made onely of <hi>Sweet-Briar,</hi> and <hi>Honny-ſuckle,</hi> and ſome <hi>Wilde Vine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt; And the Ground ſet with <hi>Violets, Strawberries,</hi> and <hi>Prime-Roſes.</hi> For theſe are Sweet, and proſper in the Shade. And theſe to be in the <hi>Heath,</hi> here and there, not in any Order. I like alſo little <hi>Heaps,</hi> in the Nature of <hi>Mole-hils,</hi> (ſuch as are in <hi>Wilde Heaths</hi>) to be ſet, ſome with Wilde Thyme; Some with Pincks; Some with Germander, that giues a good Flower to the Eye; Some with Periwinckle; Some with Violets; Some with Strawberries; Some with Couſlips; Some with Daiſies; Some with Red-Roſes; Some with Lili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Conuallium; Some with Sweet-Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams Red; Some with Beares-Foot; And the like Low Flowers, being withal Sweet, and Sightly. Part of which <hi>Heapes,</hi> to be
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:176830:146"/>with <hi>Standards,</hi> of little <hi>Buſhes,</hi> prickt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Top, and Part without. The <hi>Standards</hi> to be Roſes; Iuniper; Holly; Beare-berries (but here and there, becauſe of the Smell of their Bloſſome;) Red Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans; Gooſe-berries; Roſe-Mary; Bayes; Sweet-Briar; and ſuch like. But theſe <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards,</hi> to be kept with Cutting, that they grow not out of Courſe.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Side Grounds,</hi> you are to fill them with <hi>Varietie</hi> of <hi>Alleys,</hi> Priuate, to giue a full Shade; Some of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Sun be. You are to frame ſome of them likewiſe for Shelter, that when the Wind blows Sharpe, you may walke, as in a Gallery. And thoſe Alleys muſt be likewiſe hedged, at both Ends, to keepe out the Wind; And theſe <hi>Cloſer Alleys,</hi> muſt bee euer finely Grauelled, and no Graſſe, becauſe of Going wet. In many of theſe <hi>Alleys</hi> likewiſe, you are to ſet <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> of all Sorts; As well vpon the Walles, as in Ranges. And this would be generally obſerued, that the <hi>Borders,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you plant your <hi>Fruit-Trees,</hi> be Faire
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:176830:147"/>and Large, and Low, and not Steepe; And Set with <hi>Fine Flowers,</hi> but thin and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, leſt they Deceiue the <hi>Trees.</hi> At the End of both the <hi>Side Grounds,</hi> I would haue a <hi>Mount</hi> of ſome Pretty Height, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Wall of the Encloſure, Breſt high, to looke abroad into the Fields.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Maine Garden,</hi> I doe not Deny, but there ſhould be ſome Faire <hi>Alleys,</hi> ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on both Sides, with <hi>Fruit Trees;</hi> And ſome Pretty <hi>Tufts</hi> of <hi>Fruit Trees,</hi> And <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> with <hi>Seats,</hi> ſet in ſome Decent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; But theſe to be, by no Meanes, ſet too thicke; But to leaue the <hi>Maine Garden,</hi> ſo as it be not cloſe, but the Aire Open and Free. For as for <hi>Shade,</hi> I would haue you reſt, vpon the <hi>Alleys</hi> of the <hi>Side Grounds,</hi> there to walke, if you be Diſpoſed, in the Heat of the Yeare, or day; But to make Account, that the <hi>Maine Garden,</hi> is for the more Temperate Parts of the yeare; And in the Heat of Summer, for the Morning, and the Euening, or Ouer-caſt Dayes.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Auiaries,</hi> I like them not, except they be of that Largeneſſe, as they may be

If Affection lead a Man, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the leſſe Worthy in Deſert, let him doe it without Deprauing or Diſabling the Better Deſeruer. In <hi>Sutes,</hi> which a man doth not well vnderſtand, it is good to referre them, to ſome Frend of Truſt and Iudgement, that may report whether hee may deale in them with Honour: But let him chuſe well his Referendaries, for elſe he may be led by the Noſe. <hi>Sutours</hi> are ſo diſtaſted with Delayes, and Abuſes, that Plaine Dealing, in denying to deale

To be Ignorant of the value of a <hi>Sute,</hi> is Simplicitie; As well as to be Ignorant of the Right thereof, is Want of Conſcience.

Men had need beware, how they be too Perfect in Complements; For be they neuer ſo Sufficient otherwiſe, their Enuiers will be ſure to giue them that Attribute, to the Diſaduantage of their greater Vertues. It is loſſe alſo in buſineſſe, to be too full of <hi>Reſpects,</hi> or to be too Curious in Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Times and Opportunities. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith; <hi>He that conſidereth the wind, ſhall not

Let not the Sunne goe downe vpon your Anger. Anger</hi> muſt be limited, and confined, both in Race, and in Time. We will firſt ſpeake, How the Naturall Inclination, and Habit, <hi>To be Angry,</hi> may be attempred, and calmed. Secondly, How the Particular Motions of <hi>Anger,</hi> may be repreſſed, or at leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained from doing Miſchiefe. Thirdly, How to raiſe <hi>Anger,</hi> or appeaſe <hi>Anger,</hi> in Another.</p>
            <p>For the firſt; There is no other Way, but to Meditate and Ruminate well, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Effects of <hi>Anger,</hi> how it troubles Mans Life. And the beſt Time, to doe
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:176830:171"/>this, is, to looke backe vpon <hi>Anger,</hi> when the Fitt is throughly ouer. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith well; <hi>That Anger is like Ruine, which breakes it Selfe, vpon that it fall's.</hi> The Scripture exhorteth vs; <hi>To poſſeſſe our Soules in Patience.</hi> Whoſoeuer is out of <hi>Patience,</hi> is out of Poſſeſſion of his <hi>Soule.</hi> Men muſt not turne <hi>Bees;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anger</hi> is certainly a kinde of Baſeneſſe: As it appeares well, in the Weakneſſe of thoſe Subiects, in whom it reignes: Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Women, Old Folkes, Sicke Folkes. Onely Men muſt beware, that they carry their <hi>Anger,</hi> rather with Scorne, then with Feare: So that they may ſeeme rather, to be aboue the Iniury, then below it: which is a Thing eaſily done, if a Man will giue Law to himſelfe in it.</p>
            <p>For the Second Point; The <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Motiues</hi> of <hi>Anger,</hi> are chiefly three. Firſt, to be too <hi>Senſible</hi> of <hi>Hurt:</hi> For no Man is <hi>Angry,</hi> that <hi>Feeles</hi> not himſelfe Hurt: And therefore Tender and Delicate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, muſt needs be oft <hi>Angry:</hi> They
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:176830:171"/>haue ſo many Things to trouble them; Which more Robuſt Natures haue little Senſe of. The next is, the Apprehenſion and Conſtruction, of the Iniury offred, to be, in the Circumſtances thereof, full of <hi>Contempt.</hi> For <hi>Contempt</hi> is that which putteth an Edge vpon <hi>Anger,</hi> as much, or more, then the <hi>Hurt</hi> it ſelfe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when Men are Ingenious, in pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Circumſtances of <hi>Contempt,</hi> they doe kindle their <hi>Anger</hi> much. Laſtly, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Touch of a Mans <hi>Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> doth multiply and ſharpen. <hi>Anger.</hi> Wherein the Remedy is, that a Man ſhould haue, as <hi>Conſaluo</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>Telam Honoris craſsiorem.</hi> But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frainings of <hi>Anger,</hi> it is the beſt Remedy to win Time; And to make a Mans Selfe beleeue, that the Opportunity of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge is not yet come: But that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees a Time for it; And ſo to ſtill Himſelfe in the meane Time, and reſerue it.</p>
            <p>To containe <hi>Anger</hi> from <hi>Miſchiefe,</hi> though it take hold of a Man, there be two Things, whereof you muſt haue ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:176830:172"/>Caution. The one, of extreme <hi>Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of Words;</hi> Eſpecially, if they be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culeate, and Proper: For <hi>Communia Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta</hi> are nothing ſo much: And againe, that in <hi>Anger,</hi> a Man reueale no Secrets: For that makes him not fit for Society. The other, that you doe not <hi>peremptorily breake off,</hi> in any Buſineſſe, in a <hi>Fit</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi> But howſoeuer you <hi>ſhew</hi> Bitternes, do not <hi>Act</hi> any thing, that is not Reuocable.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Raiſing</hi> and <hi>Appeaſing Anger</hi> in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; It is done chiefly, by <hi>Chooſing of Times.</hi> When Men are frowardeſt and worſt diſpoſed, to incenſe them. Againe, by gathering (as was touched before) all that you can finde out, to aggrauate the <hi>Contempt.</hi> And the two <hi>Remedies</hi> are by the <hi>Contraries.</hi> The Former, to take good Times, when firſt to relate to a Man, an <hi>Angry</hi> Buſineſſe: For the firſt Impreſſion is much. And the other is, to ſeuer, as much as may be, the Conſtruction of the Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from the Point of <hi>Contempt:</hi> Imputing it, to Miſunderſtanding, Feare, Paſſion, or what you will.</p>

There is an abſtruſe Aſtrologer that ſaith; <hi>If it were not, for two things, that are Conſtant; (The one is, that the Fixed Starres euer ſtand at like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, one from another, and neuer come nearer together, nor goe further aſunder; The other, that the Diurnall Motion perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually keepeth Time:) No Indiuiduall would laſt one Moment.</hi> Certain it is, that the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:176830:173"/>is in a Perpetuall Flux, and neuer at a Stay. The great Winding-ſheets, that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie all Things in Obliuion, are two; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luges,</hi> and <hi>Earth-quakes.</hi> As for <hi>Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and great <hi>Droughts,</hi> they doe not meerely diſpeople, and deſtroy. <hi>Phaetons</hi> Carre went but a day. And the <hi>Three yeares Drought,</hi> in the time of <hi>Elias,</hi> was but Particular, and left People Aliue. As for the great <hi>Burnings by Lightnings,</hi> which are often in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> they are but narrow. But in the other two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, by <hi>Deluge,</hi> and <hi>Earth-quake,</hi> it is further to be noted, that the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of People, which hap to be reſerued, are commonly Ignorant and Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous People, that can giue no Account, of the Time paſt: So that the Obliuion is all one, as if none had beene left. If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well, of the People of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> it is very probable, that they are a Newer, or a Younger People, then the People of the Old World. And it is much more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Deſtruction, that hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been there, was not by <hi>Earth-quakes,</hi>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:176830:173"/>(As the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſt told <hi>Solon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Iſland of <hi>Atlantis; That it was ſwallowed by an Earth-quake;</hi>) But rather, that it was deſolated, by a Particular <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</hi> For <hi>Earth-quakes</hi> are ſeldome in thoſe Parts. But on the other ſide, they haue ſuch <hi>Powring Riuers,</hi> as the <hi>Riuers</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Affrick,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> are but Brookes to them. Their <hi>Andes</hi> likewiſe, or Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, are farre higher, then thoſe with vs; Whereby it ſeemes, that the Remnants of Generation of Men, were, in ſuch a Particular <hi>Deluge,</hi> ſaued. As for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, that <hi>Macciauel</hi> hath, that the <hi>Iealouſie</hi> of <hi>Sects,</hi> doth much extinguiſh the Memory of Things; Traducing <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> that he did, what in him lay, to extinguiſh all Heathen Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; I doe not finde, that thoſe Zeales, doe any great Effects, nor laſt long: As it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Succeſſion of <hi>Sabinian,</hi> who did reuiue the former Antiquities.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Viciſsitude</hi> or <hi>Mutations,</hi> in the <hi>Superiour Globe,</hi> are no fit Matter, for this preſent Argument. It may be, <hi>Plato's great
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:176830:174"/>Yeare,</hi> if the World ſhould laſt ſo long, would haue ſome Effect; Not in renewing the State of like Indiuiduals (for that is the Fume of thoſe, that conceiue the Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Bodies, haue more accurate Influences, vpon theſe Things below, then indeed they haue) but in groſſe. <hi>Comets,</hi> out of queſtion, haue likewiſe Power and Effect, ouer the Groſſe and Maſſe of Things: But they are rather gazed vpon, and waited vpon in their Iourney, then wiſely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in their Effects; Specially in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiue Effects; That is, what Kinde of <hi>Comet,</hi> for Magnitude, Colour, Verſion of the Beames, Placing in the Region of Heauen, or Laſting, produceth what Kinde of Effects.</p>
            <p>There is a Toy, which I haue heard, and I would not haue it giuen ouer, but waited vpon a little. They ſay, it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> (I know not in what Part) that Euery Fiue and Thirtie years, The ſame Kinde and Sute of Years and Weathers, comes about againe: As Great Froſts, Great Wet, Great Droughts,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:176830:174"/>Warme Winters, Summers with little Heat, and the like: And they call it the <hi>Prime.</hi> It is a Thing, I doe the rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe computing backwards, I haue found ſome Concurrence.</p>
            <p>But to leaue theſe Points of <hi>Nature,</hi> and to come to <hi>Men.</hi> The greateſt <hi>Viciſsitude</hi> of Things amongſt <hi>Men,</hi> is the <hi>Viciſsitude</hi> of <hi>Sects,</hi> and <hi>Religions.</hi> For thoſe Orbs rule in Mens Minds moſt. The True <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is <hi>built vpon the Rocke;</hi> The Reſt are toſt vpon the Waues of Time. To ſpeake therefore, of the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of New <hi>Sects;</hi> And to giue ſome <hi>Counſell</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them; As farre, as the Weakneſſe of Humane Iudgement, can giue ſtay to ſo great Reuolutions.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Religion</hi> formerly receiued, is rent by Diſcords; And when the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Profeſſours of <hi>Religion</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and full of Scandall; And withall the Times be Stupid, Ignorant, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous; you may doubt the Springing vp of a <hi>New Sect;</hi> If then alſo there ſhould ariſe, any Extrauagant and Strange Spirit,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:176830:175"/>to make himſelfe Authour thereof. All which Points held, when <hi>Mahomet</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his <hi>Law.</hi> If a <hi>New Sect</hi> haue not two Properties, feare it not: For it will not ſpread. The one is, the Supplanting, or the oppoſing, of Authority eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: For Nothing is more Popular then that. The other is, the Giuing Licence to Pleaſures, and a Voluptuous Life. For as for <hi>Speculatiue Hereſies</hi> (ſuch as were in Ancient Times the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and now the <hi>Arminians</hi>) though they worke mightily vpon Mens Wits, yet they doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any great Alterations in States; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be by the Helpe of Ciuill Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There be three Manner of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>New Sects.</hi> By the Power of <hi>Signes</hi> and <hi>Miracles:</hi> By the <hi>Eloquence and Wiſedome</hi> of <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Perſwaſion:</hi> And by the <hi>Sword.</hi> For <hi>Martyrdomes,</hi> I reckon them amongſt <hi>Miracles;</hi> Becauſe they ſeeme to exceed, the Strength of Human Nature: And I may doe the like of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue</hi> and <hi>Admirable Holineſſe</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> Surely, there is no better Way, to ſtop the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:176830:175"/>Riſing of <hi>New Sects,</hi> and <hi>Schiſmes;</hi> then To reforme Abuſes; To compound the ſmaller Differences; To proceed mildly, and not with Sanguinary Perſecutions; And rather to take off the principall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, by Winning and Aduancing them, then to enrage them by Violence and Bitterneſſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Changes</hi> and <hi>Viciſsitude</hi> in <hi>Warres</hi> are many: But chiefly in three Things; In the <hi>Seats</hi> or <hi>Stages</hi> of the <hi>Warre;</hi> In the <hi>Weapons;</hi> And in the <hi>Manner</hi> of the <hi>Conduct. Warres</hi> in ancient Time, ſeemed more to moue from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt:</hi> For the <hi>Perſians, Aſsyrians, Arabians, Tartars,</hi> (which were the Inuaders) were all Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne People. It is true, the <hi>Gaules</hi> were Weſterne; But we reade but of two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of theirs; The one to <hi>Gallo-Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> the other to <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> haue no certaine Points of Heauen: And no more haue the <hi>Warres,</hi> either from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> or <hi>Weſt,</hi> any Certainty of Obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> are fixed: And it hath ſeldome or neuer been ſeene, that
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:176830:176"/>the farre Southern People haue inuaded the Northern, but contrariwiſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Northern Tract</hi> of the World, is in Nature the more Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Region: Be it, in reſpect of the Stars of that Hemiſphere; Or of the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents that are vpon the <hi>North,</hi> whereas the <hi>South Part,</hi> for ought that is knowne, is almoſt all Sea; Or (which is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent) of the Cold of the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts, which is that, which without Aid of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, doth make the Bodies hardeſt, and the Courages warmeſt.</p>
            <p>Vpon the <hi>Breaking</hi> and <hi>Shiuering</hi> of a great <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Empire,</hi> you may be ſure to haue <hi>Warres.</hi> For great Empires, while they ſtand, doe eneruate and deſtroy the Forces of the Natiues, which they haue ſubdued, reſting vpon their owne Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Forces: And then when they faile alſo, all goes to ruine, and they become a Prey. So was it, in the Decay of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire;</hi> And likewiſe, in the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Almaigne,</hi> after <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, euery Bird taking a Fether; And were not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:176830:176"/>to befall to <hi>Spaine,</hi> if it ſhould break The great <hi>Acceſsions</hi> and <hi>Vnions</hi> of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,</hi> doe likewiſe ſtirre vp <hi>Warres.</hi> For when a State growes to an Ouer-power, it is like a great Floud, that will be ſure to ouerflow. As it hath been ſeene, in the States of <hi>Rome, Turky, Spaine,</hi> and others. Looke when the World hath feweſt <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Peoples,</hi> but ſuch as commonly will not marry or generate, except they know meanes to liue; (As it is almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where at this day, except <hi>Tartary</hi>) there is no Danger of Inundations of People: But when there be <hi>great Shoales</hi> of <hi>People,</hi> which goe on to populate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out foreſeeing Meanes of Life and Suſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it is of Neceſſity, that once in an Age or two, they diſcharge a Portion of their People vpon other Nations: Which the ancient <hi>Northern People,</hi> were wont to doe by Lot: Caſting Lots, what Part ſhould ſlay at home, and what ſhould ſeeke their Fortunes. When a <hi>Warre-like State</hi> growes <hi>Soft</hi> and <hi>Effeminate,</hi> they may be ſure of a <hi>Warre.</hi> For commonly
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:176830:177"/>ſuch States are growne rich, in the time of their Degenerating; And ſo the Prey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiteth, and their Decay in Valour encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth a Warre.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Weapons,</hi> it hardly falleth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Rule and Obſeruation: yet we ſee, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen they haue <hi>Returnes</hi> and <hi>Viciſsitudes.</hi> For certain it is, that <hi>Ordnance</hi> was known in the Citty of the <hi>Oxidrakes</hi> in <hi>India;</hi> And was that, which the <hi>Macedonians</hi> called Thunder and Lightning, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke. And it is well knowne, that the vſe of <hi>Ordnance</hi> hath been in <hi>China,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 2000. yeares. The Conditions of <hi>Weapons,</hi> &amp; their Improuement are; Firſt, The Fetching a farre off: For that outruns the Danger: As it is ſeene in <hi>Ordnance</hi> and <hi>Muskets.</hi> Secondly, the Strength of the Percuſſion, wherin likewiſe <hi>Ordnance</hi> doe exceed all Arietations, and ancient Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The third is, the commodious vſe of them: As that they may ſerue in all We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; That the Carriage may be Light and Manageable; and the like.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Conduct</hi> of the <hi>Warre:</hi> At the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:176830:177"/>firſt, Men reſted extremely vpon <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</hi> They did put the Warres likewiſe vpon <hi>Maine Force,</hi> and <hi>Valour;</hi> Pointing Dayes for Pitched Fields, and ſo trying it out, vpon an euen Match: And they were more ignorant in <hi>Ranging</hi> and <hi>Arraying</hi> their <hi>Battailes.</hi> After they grew to reſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Number,</hi> rather Competent, then Vaſt: They grew to <hi>Aduantages,</hi> of <hi>Place, Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Diuerſions,</hi> and the like: And they grew more skilful in the <hi>Ordering</hi> of their <hi>Battailes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Youth</hi> of a <hi>State, Armes</hi> doe flouriſh: In the <hi>Middle Age</hi> of a <hi>State, Learning;</hi> And then both of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a time: In the <hi>Declining Age</hi> of a <hi>State, Mechanicall Arts</hi> and <hi>Merchandize.
